			 <p>I have been genuinely enjoying (for the most part) my several months-long journey, now, exploring the experience of perhaps the eldest elder iOS word processing application, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1225571038" title="Ulysses on the App Store">Ulysses</a>, and its <em>just have to use it to discover</em> delights.</p>
<p>Poking around for just a moment, I discovered what is apparently a quite excellent example of perhaps my least favorite sort of digital type: Monotype&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/itc-american-typewriter" title="ITC American Pro - Adobe Fonts">ITC American Pro</a></em> family.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.davidblue.bio/uploads/2022/53011c9dd7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It took me disturbingly little time to find a correspondingly foul typewriter-inspired entry in my list of Ulysses themes, called <a href="https://styles.ulysses.app/themes/remington-xBr" title="Remington Ulysses Theme">Remington</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reminds on the good old Remington Typewriter with black and red ribbon. The background color is a light grey for an eye-friendly work. Recommended font: Courier or Courier new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.davidblue.bio/uploads/2022/60d3738fbe.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Less abrasive to my eye, here&rsquo;s the same typeface wearing the <a href="https://styles.ulysses.app/themes/watterson-VVK" title="Watterson Ulysses Theme">Watterson Theme</a> in portrait mode.</p>
<p>If your ball&rsquo;s not already gagging away, here&rsquo;s one more <em>tidbit</em>:</p>
<p>Both of these images were captured with Ulysses in fucking <strong>[typewriter <em>mode</em>](<a href="https://ghost-staging.ulysses.app/typewriter-mode/">https://ghost-staging.ulysses.app/typewriter-mode/</a> &ldquo;&ldquo;For Better Focus: Typewriter Mode, Revamped&rdquo; - The Ulysses Blog&rdquo;)</strong>, even, configured to select by sentence.</p>
<p>&hellip;which, ya know&hellip; could probably turn my whole writing life around.</p>

			 <p>I got a DM from my friend and former podcast co-host Katie Notopoulos last night asking if I wanted to do a Twitter Space to say goodbye to the app while it was still possible. I, who had spent most of the day off Twitter and most of the evening catching up on <em>White Lotus</em> season 2, had no idea what she was talking about. The site is still running as of this morning, but last night it felt as if the whole thing might go down at any second. It still seems like a critical system failure is imminent now that large chunks of the company&rsquo;s remaining workforce are quitting.</p>
<p>Over the span of three hours last night, members of the site&rsquo;s various communities, cultures, and subcultures walked across the great digital divide to come sit by our campfire and say their piece about the bird site that has hurt so many of us just as often as it has acted as a vital lifeline. At one point we had 21,000 concurrent listeners in the Space, including some high profile users such as one famously Twitter-addicted model-slash-cookbook writer who ignored my requests for her to speak. We had black activists and writers, members of the disabled community, and users in countries like India, Australia, Ghana, and Mexico. We also had furries, gamers, fandom bloggers, and that one guy who tweets every time he cranks off. And, of course, most of New York media. In other words, we had Twitter.</p>
<p>And a consensus started to form last night about Twitter, a site that has maybe had more words written about it than any website in existence, but one that still remains a tricky enigma for its most diehard users. What makes Twitter a hell site is also what makes it work. Users come to it for news, community, activism, shitposts, or the Twitter-esque combination of all four, and that only works because of the site&rsquo;s chronological newsfeed, the ease of posting a tweet, and the site&rsquo;s proximity to power. My favorite take on Twitter is from the always sharp Michael Hobbes, who <a href="https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark/status/1519199745801170944">wrote</a> in April, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll look back on the last decade as a time when social media gave previously marginalized groups the ability to speak directly to elites and, as a result, elites lost their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twitter is the neighborhood dive bar of the internet, a place where you are just as likely to get your wallet stolen as you are to meet the love of your life. A place that was never very good, but because of its extreme lack of pretension, or inability to have any, it also is the place that keeps its doors open in times of need. As of right now, the bar&rsquo;s still open, but a rich land developer owns it, the staff have all quit in protest, and the regular patrons are all trying to figure out whether they should be trying to save it or jump behind the counter and drink from the tap. The rapper Cardi B tweeted out hardcore porn last night, which makes me think it will increasingly be the latter.</p>
<p>Life in an online world is a contradiction. One we still have problems expressing. The internet connects us, but not physically. It&rsquo;s a collection of shared experiences, but ones we all have in deeply personal and different ways. And the online spaces we spend time on matter to us, but are also full of dumb bull shit. Even if Twitter hobbles along like this for weeks or months, it&rsquo;s safe to say that it&rsquo;s not coming back the same, even if Musk miraculously stirs the ship back on course. This era of Twitter is over and it&rsquo;s ok to be sad about that, but it&rsquo;s also ok to feel silly that you feel sad about that.</p>

<h2 id="a-safari-through-the-enchanting-space-of-third-party-mastodon-clients-on-ios">A safari through the enchanting space of third-party Mastodon clients on iOS.</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and went as I wrote this guide - you can metaphorically picture me looking up from my machine having overheard the news of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">2021 Apple Design Award Winners</a> announcement. Perusing through them, I saw two I would have voted for, myself: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574">CARROT Weather</a> - the <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1368223231111557125">beautifully vulgar</a>, grumpy bitch frontend for your preferred weather information service, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127">Craft</a> - perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two or three years - listed under &ldquo;Finalists.&rdquo; (Read: losers.) The most positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/"><strong>Be My Eyes</strong></a>, which &ldquo;connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers and company representatives for visual assistance through a live video call,&rdquo; along with an exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader/id496177674">Voice Dream Reader</a>. <em>However</em>, a double take in games from *Genshin Impact- and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990">the fucking *League of Legends- game</a> certainly sours the mouth and suggests yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has <em>sold out</em>.</p>
<p>The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth&rsquo;s sake over any and all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but there *is- an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted software. The necessity of this guide - and the bizarrely silent ignorance of even the &ldquo;fringes&rdquo; on its subject - is unimaginably severe. Before me has been (for years, now,) the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; to a Jolly Big Load of what tech and marketing types lament in more and more existential language, yet * hardly any- of the humans with the most to lose from their negligence - regular, casual social media users - have been delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated. <strong>The journalism is not being done.</strong></p>
<p>I know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one motherfucker&rsquo;s complaints about WWDC, but - as with everything Apple, Inc. does - every morsel of curatorial expression/discrimination/favoritism from The Great Money God within this platform *must- be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I found myself completely at a loss as to how *not- to dwell on the Discovery Disparity, here.</p>
<p>Despite how deeply I&rsquo;ve gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I&rsquo;ve ever seen remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.&rsquo;s mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I&rsquo;ve invested into App Guides - a space to which I never would have imagined intentionally bringing *The Psalms- - I hope you can understand.</p>
<p>I must confess: I have been <em>meaning</em> to write this app guide since even before I <a href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview">interviewed Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko</a> on the morning of his Big Press Day, just over 4 years ago. I’ve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself, published an <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/">official blog post</a> at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform.” As a Patreon supporter of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">The Mastodon Project</a> (full disclosure,) I&rsquo;ve been testing this app (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature applications in their own right. (Also, it’s become quite apparent that the normal tech media sources you’d go to for such a guide aren’t going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Y624NGHM.jpg" alt="Masto Mascot iOS Art"></p>
<h2 id="obligatory-context">Obligatory(?) Context</h2>
<p>I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who&rsquo;s function is to prompt academic conversations about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social&rsquo;s solutions to all of the Big Web&rsquo;s Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though I have been compelled to <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bigblue">invest significantly</a> in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that <strong>Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social space</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know, this seems to have become <em>my general shit</em>, for lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open source/&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; software are very important, yes! &hellip; but they are *far- from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The second of <a href="https://bilge.world/about">this World Wide Web Blog&rsquo;s fundamental considerations</a>, in fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their *brand image- (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. <strong>Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blog on which you&rsquo;re reading this, in fact, is federated on <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. If you so chose, you could be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The crucial point, though, is that *you didn&rsquo;t need to know that- - you could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy regarding Federation.</p>
<p>*Oh boy, here we go&hellip;- No. I did not want to say anything ideological - I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit posts I&rsquo;ve seen to the tune of &ldquo;is there an iPhone app?&rdquo; As I explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless - sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been *so- much easier than I thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you&rsquo;ve actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you&rsquo;re undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called &ldquo;feature overlap&rdquo; at one time has become all but the platform&rsquo;s core ethos. If you&rsquo;re the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is currently oversaturated nigh *beyond usability- with mediocre entries built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function. This, alone, wouldn&rsquo;t be so problematic if Discovery were not so <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1379068906917224448">completely and totally Fucked</a> (except when <a href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/">dev-facing</a>,) but I needn&rsquo;t comment further on that subject at the moment - I&rsquo;m just trying emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single protocol/service&rsquo;s third-party client representation on iOS to be so thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of these apps <em>in a functional state</em>, actually. In all my equivalent experiences downloading the entirety of a given service&rsquo;s API-supported palette (e.g. IRC apps, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover">topically</a>,) an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that *actually work- at the given moment. (I&rsquo;d have mentioned the &ldquo;best [service/task] iPhone apps for [year]&rdquo; listicles found in online publications like *Digital Trends- were it not for the percentage of them in which it&rsquo;s clear the author *did not actually download- some/most of the apps listed‽‽‽) Perhaps due to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97">iOS 14.5&rsquo;s implementation of ATT</a>, all of the Mastodon apps I could find and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness' interest) are currently functioning.</p>
<p>So, if there&rsquo;s virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download one of the apps we&rsquo;re about to consider and find it broken, what practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery intriguing, hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-6">The Big 6</h2>
<p>My first step in writing this guide was to post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/mxymr1/your*thoughts*on*thirdparty*mastodon*clients*for/">a thread on r/Mastodon</a> soliciting thoughts on third-party Mastodon apps from other users, who expressed a lot of love for Toot! and Metatext:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games&hellip;which really aren&rsquo;t needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mikepictor/">u/mikepictor</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pragmatic Code&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426">Linky</a> was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It&rsquo;s not a client, but a bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it is an obligatory mention. So too is the <a href="https://github.com/extratone/mastodon-ios-apps"><strong>GitHub Repository/List</strong></a> I created in order to &ldquo;formally&rdquo; offer a list with much greater brevity and zero editorialization.</p>
<p>First, let’s begin with The Big 6 - those apps The Mastodon Project, itself, has seen fit to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">list on joinmastodon.org</a>.</p>

<p>Dag Ågren‘s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a> is not only my personal app of choice - I would (and have) go so far as to say it’s the single most innovative mobile social app I’ve ever encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection. It’s held a place in my phone’s dock since the day I first downloaded it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J">its wholly unique Share Sheet interface</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png" alt="Toot! Themes"></p>
<p>Toot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am quite superficial in my taste. It’s Obsidian theme (which may or may not be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is especially gorgeous.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106302686196643266">cacophonous attempt</a> to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps simultaneously, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Toot!&rsquo;s always came first. Its <a href="https://whyp.it/t/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997">charming custom audio alerts</a> also make them my favorite by far.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered function of these apps - serving as representing the network as a whole - it occurred to me that <strong>Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone have prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild than I can count</strong>. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding mechanism.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/30YJR456.png" alt="Toot! Settings"></p>
<p>In my experience, it’s also the most robust of the lot - as in, it is very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>I originally had high hopes for Shihab Mehboob‘s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129">Mast</a> - which used to look very different from the way it does, today. That’s almost certainly to do with its ownership <a href="https://twitter.com/jpeguin/status/1354854403124178947">changing hands</a> at some point (no, I do not have any further details on that story, unfortunately.) That’s not to say the current app isn’t a worthwhile offering, it’s just far less <em>visually ambitious</em> than the original I remember. However, it’s also significantly more reliable.</p>

<p>The Original… Genesis… If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon app on the App Store, it’s certainly the oldest to survive. Its GitHub Repository’s <a href="https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86">first commit</a> dates back to April 17th, 2017. While you’re there, you might note that it’s the only one of these entries coded entirely in Objective-C - the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS before Swift’s birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It’s been nearly a year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it <em>does</em> include are rock solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???</p>

<p>For better or worse, <a href="https://mstdn.rinsuki.net/@rinsuki">@rinsuki</a>’s iMast will require either a basic grasp of the Japanese language, or the patience to translate its menus and work backwards. (OCR came to mind, but I’m not quite dedicated enough to try it for this guide.) Assuming <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:64ce057e-5adc-4578-a0ef-e9ddb6b5d545">Google’s translation</a> of <a href="https://cinderella-project.github.io/iMast/">its GitHub Pages site</a> is correct, iMast is also Open Source “under the Apache License 2.” Unlike Amaroq, it appears to have been built in Swift from the ground up. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s about all I can comment on, though I would very much love to hear from any iMast users/Japanese speakers and will update this Post accordingly.</p>

<p>Daniel Nitsikopoulos' <a href="https://onmercury.app">Mercury</a> represents yet another entirely original direction in Social clients. It&rsquo;s fresh and &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; in its explicit lack of support for instances that &ldquo;<a href="https://onmercury.app/help">promote abuse and harassment</a>.&rdquo; From all appearances, this appears to be the singular source of negative reviews on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mercury-for-mastodon/id1486749200">its iOS App Store page</a>. It&rsquo;s also the other option to offer widgets integration (in a single form, currently,) and custom audio notifications, though I couldn&rsquo;t capture a sample. Its <a href="https://trello.com/b/6EseiLSQ/mercury-roadmap">Trello Roadmap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dNitza/mercury-issues/issues">Feedback Repo</a> are public but mostly inactive. As you can see in the grid embedded above, I absolutely adore its Scoops theme and find my $0.99 Tip 100% worth its custom icons.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unfortunately, the state of Mercury&rsquo;s App Store reviews prompt yet another essential economic/editorial consideration. The one in the very center of the image embedded, above - from &ldquo;FeralDandelion&rdquo; - is the singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is <strong>exhaustively explicit about this from very get-go</strong>. Its <a href="https://onmercury.app/help">single-page Help document</a> includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every single blocked instance and *the specific justification- for each respective instance&rsquo;s presence on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as such does not support many instances that promote abuse and harassment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is <strong>exclusively positive</strong>. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort of fixation on ideology for ideology&rsquo;s sake that even Lucky Linus himself has no patience for. Instead, <em>thank Gourd- Mercury&rsquo;s developers took the time to better your social experience! In response to statements like the pullquote above, I expect &mdash;only- thumbs in the air</em>- from this point, forward.</p>

<p>Metatext is perhaps the buzziest of all these apps - well-praised in every space I could find conversation on the subject. It&rsquo;s developed under <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jzzocc">Justin Mazzocchi</a>&rsquo;s software studio, <a href="https://metabolist.org/">Metabolist</a> and is as <a href="https://github.com/metabolist/metatext">Open Source</a> as it gets! (As per my hardware keyboard shortcuts crusade, I added <a href="https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/issues/40">my own issue</a> requesting support.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GummyKibble/">u/GummyKibble</a> noted that &ldquo;it looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS.&rdquo; This term - *native- - seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what it means, and I do agree, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that I speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I think &ldquo;native&rdquo; can be translated as *generally of a stout, sturdy disposition*, thanks to the care put into honing said balance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely positive which Mastodon app was *actually- the first on my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp">App Store Page</a> Version History suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app - which was apparently &ldquo;Designed for iPad&rdquo; - appears to be working just fine. There are some overlapping UI elements, but they&rsquo;re barely noticeable. Were it not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.</p>
<p>In my search for any extra-App Store representation other than <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp">Tootle&rsquo;s Mastodon Account</a> (which last posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered <a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/11/tootle-l-gtk3-mastodon-client-linux/">Tootle&hellip; for Linux</a>. Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until Lubuntu finally functioned *just- so I could show you what it looks like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and *even- wearing the new official Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you&rsquo;ll agree&hellip; Tootle for Linux is not related to Tootle.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Rx3Eu9GA.png" alt="Tootle for Linux"></p>
<p>Personally, I find this a profound shame - I think more apps should be as colorful - and as color *configurable- - as this little, mysterious Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames embedded above using *The Psalms- colors, naturally, and the whole process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember doing, all those years ago, and you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard it is to create an unusable color theme. What I find *most- shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store searches, now. (And by &ldquo;*most- shame,&rdquo; you know I really mean <em>entirely fucking unacceptable</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="tuskerhttpstestflightapplecomjoinwtb7hyvg"><a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG">Tusker</a></h3>
<p>I found my way to the only *currently in-development- entry on this list thanks to my Mastodon friend <a href="https://social.wake.st/@liaizon">wakest</a>. iOS developer <a href="https://social.shadowfacts.net/users/shadowfacts">Shadowfacts</a> (who also maintains <a href="https://shadowfacts.net/"><em>shadowfacts.net</em></a>) is working on their considerate, distinct app, Tusker in <a href="https://git.shadowfacts.net/shadowfacts/Tusker">this self-hosted Repository</a>. In <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/timelines/tag/tusker">^tusker</a> on Mastodon, you&rsquo;ll find a few poignant praises from <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> founder and principal developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dansup">Dan Sup</a>, which - from my perspective - are especially high, indeed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jZudSEdQ.png" alt="Tusker Landscape Mode!"></p>
<p>Tusker&rsquo;s color customization options are technically&hellip; well.. <em>not infinite</em>, like other apps here, but the end result of their (obviously, very considered) selection will be a net win for 100% of users over that alternative, I believe. It is definitely of a similar philosophy to Metatext, but unquestionably more ambitious. Out of the lot, testing Tusker was the singular instance in which I found myself considering a &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; for Toot! You, yourself can use Tusker *right this very minute- via Apple&rsquo;s beta distribution system, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">Testflight</a>, via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG"><strong>this invite link</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/oBYO4T1e.png" alt="Roma for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="romahttpsappsapplecomusapproma-for-pleroma-and-mastodonid1445328699"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roma-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1445328699">Roma</a></h3>
<p>Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast&rsquo;s original developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/JPEGuin">Shihab Meboob</a>, on Twitter, but frankly, I&rsquo;ve already bothered him enough there over the years, so it&rsquo;s understandable that I didn&rsquo;t hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on <a href="https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop">Roma&rsquo;s web page</a> and noticed its similarity to <a href="https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents">Whalebird</a>, I decided to use the site&rsquo;s contact form to <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md">inquire</a> about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I received a reply just *minutes- later from Leo Radvinsky, head of <a href="https://leo.com/">Leo.com</a>, &ldquo;a Florida-based boutique venture capital fund that invests in technology companies:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It didn&rsquo;t really work out so now we&rsquo;re working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&amp;hl=en</a>*US&amp;gl=US</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281">apps.apple.com/in/app/fe&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it&rsquo;s no longer supported.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any other questions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing *<em>actual capital</em>- into federated social is certainly worth celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as you&rsquo;re reading this, I insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/4TO8CL5D.png" alt="Fedi for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="fedihttpsappsapplecomusappfedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodonid1478806281"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281">Fedi</a></h3>
<p>Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established by Mast and Roma - known by *Fedi- - should be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my relative lack of experience with <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> - another ActivityPub-based, federated social network - won&rsquo;t let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi&rsquo;s UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly disregarding my <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791">recently-acquired</a> preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision - to disregard the whole modern template for social apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps' blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very high hopes for Fedi.</p>

<h3 id="dudu-嘟嘟httpsbitlyduduios"><a href="https://bit.ly/duduios">DUDU (嘟嘟)</a></h3>
<p>DUDU (or &ldquo;嘟嘟,&rdquo; which translates to &ldquo;Toot,&rdquo; appropriately,) definitely wins for <em>Cutest Iconography</em>. It&rsquo;s a non-English-native application with exceptional English support, which I personally appreciate very much. Compared the entries immediately above, DUDU represents a much more modest interpretation of what a Mastodon client can offer. It’s robust, free of over-animation, and - most distinctly - very <em>wide</em>, which might have something to do with the &ldquo;designed for iPad&rdquo; subtitle on its App Store Page.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AZ7fRWc7.png" alt="Tootoise for iOS"></p>

<p>Yet another &ldquo;Designed for iPad&rdquo; entry, Naoki Kuwata&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190">Tootoise</a> is defined by its custom incoming post rate accommodations and its gorgeous Solarized theme. Its &ldquo;Max number of new arrival posts&rdquo; setting ranges from 0-400, allowing one to freeze their timeline entirely from any accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments, anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately apparent when one actually begins to explore it, especially for those who have come to Mastodon after feeling overwhelmed by Big Social.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/LzzNxqj9.png" alt="Stella for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="stellahttpsappsapplecomusappstellaid921372048"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stella/id921372048">Stella</a></h3>
<p>Yet another entirely one-of-a-kind experience, the slightly-mysterious Stella is listed as a &ldquo;Mastodon, Twitter &amp; News Client,&rdquo; and is notably one of the two apps on this list which do indeed support Twitter! More than that, it is the first app I&rsquo;ve seen in a very long time that allows one to *simultaneously- post to two separate social services (Twitter and Mastodon, in this case.) Without documentation, it&rsquo;s a bit clunky, but its customizable timelines feature also allows one to combine multiple &ldquo;sources&rdquo; (social accounts) into a single timeline.</p>

<p>B4X is yet another quite perplexing entry. The &ldquo;Developer Website&rdquo; link on its App Store Page leads to <a href="https://www.b4x.com/contact*us.html">b4x.com</a> - a web page entitled &ldquo;Anywhere Software.&rdquo; The GitHub icon in its footer led me to discover <a href="https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4X-Pleroma">a repository</a> which is labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development space for the iOS app we&rsquo;re discussing, but does not contain a single .swift or .pbxproj file - universally essential for iOS apps, as I understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere Software&rsquo;s &ldquo;rapid application development tools.&rdquo; I like its elemental simplicity and nice &lsquo;n&rsquo; wide post display.</p>

<p>Isao Takeyasu&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oyakodon-for-mastodon/id1229174544">Oyakodon</a> feels a bit like it originally began as a school project, and I mean that in the best possible sense. While it’s probably the least polished of the lot - and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client - is is far from a throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu’s mind was clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon’s Facebook-style theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how furious its creator must have been.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AFbihGYF.jpeg" alt="Oyakodon Cute Theme Palette"></p>
<p>Truly diabolical design, there. For better or worse, Oyakodon doesn’t really work very well in its current state, but it <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/D34uONFT.png" alt="StarPterano for iOS"></p>

<p>I very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very first moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on the App Store - buried as it was - brought me a particular sort of joy. If I’m not mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though, is that it <em>works</em>. On my 12 Pro Max, it’s exceptionally smooth, in fact.</p>

<p>I would imagine those <em>real</em> iOS developers among you should find <a href="https://github.com/pgostation/StarPterano-iOS5">StarPterano’s GitHub Repository</a> particularly interesting, considering. In the interest of preservation, I have <a href="https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/StarPterano">forked it</a> as well, and fully intend to dive in to its code, one of these days. The audio player embedded above cites a three-second .mp3 file in the repository which perhaps once accounted for the “Sounds” toggle still found in the Settings menu of StarPterano’s current build. I couldn’t get the app to reproduce it, which is actually what set me on the hunt that led to the repo.</p>

<p>Ore2 is another (apparently) non-English-native Mastodon client focused on consolidating Mastodon and Twitter within a single space. Alongside Stella, it&rsquo;s the second of the first two apps I&rsquo;ve come across in a very long time which allows one to post to both services simultaneously. Considerable work was obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs switchable with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current crossposting configuration via <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br">this (generously-public) web tool</a>, but I am all but certain those users exist who will find Ore2’s setup preferable.</p>

<p>Inadvertently, I have saved the best story of the lot for last. Developer and researcher Zhiyuan Zheng documents both the narrative context leading up to the creation of his first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269">tooot</a>, as well as the philosophy behind its design in “<a href="https://xmflsct.com/2021/tooot/">Building my first app - toot</a>.” His reference to the downfall of a prominent social app in mainland China called Douban - and the “Douban Refugees” which resulted - are alarmingly missing from all English news organizations save for <a href="https://qz.com/1726194/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals/">a single <em>Quartz</em> article</a> from October 2019. He eludes to a “boom” of Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of “user friendly mobile clients” which I can only assume to be a conundrum specific to China.</p>
<p>“With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client for Douban Refugees,” he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a] recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was clearly a major design consideration for tooot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core consists of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I very much appreciate Zhiyuan writing publicly about his thoughts on decentralized social and sharing specific considerations in his app’s design and look forward to continued updates.</p>
<h2 id="get-bent-big-social">Get Bent, Big Social</h2>
<p>A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory mentions. First - in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social counterparts - they are all <em>ridiculously</em> <strong>frugal</strong>. Not a one weighs over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494">often exceed 100mb</a>. They are all astonishingly *<em>robust</em>- - I did not experience a single crash in the course of normal testing these &ldquo;alt&rdquo; social apps- even from the beta builds - while I distinctly remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly *<em>interoperable</em>- by the ActivityPub standard. My <a href="https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue">PixelFed</a> posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from <a href="https://diasp.org/">Diaspora</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, and Mastodon, itself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate this? I, David Blue - the vain fucker with a precollection for the most superficial variables of software design *so- healthy that I have on multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific applications *entirely because of their available color palettes*&hellip; <strong>It is I who requires you to take a good fucking look</strong>, because this list of decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a goddamned fashion show.</p>
<h2 id="continuing-to-explore-social-ownership">Continuing to Explore Social Ownership</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png" alt="Mastodon Account Wordcloud"></p>
<p>This couldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;just&rdquo; an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It&rsquo;d feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be <em>life-changing</em>, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming &ldquo;official&rdquo; Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing <em>for the user</em>&hellip; None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly <em>infinitely shared</em>. I don&rsquo;t know anything about business, but I *do- know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it &ldquo;should&rdquo; be.</p>
<p>From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they&rsquo;re far from curious, &ldquo;niche&rdquo; or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these &ldquo;alt&rdquo; social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly *and- fucking broken. &ldquo;Giving social networking back to you&rdquo; has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!&rsquo;s &ldquo;take a break&rdquo; blue screen, Amaroq&rsquo;s mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast&rsquo;s music app integration, Mercury&rsquo;s configurable timelines, Metatext&rsquo;s native solidity, Tootle&rsquo;s custom colors, Tusker&rsquo;s Digital Wellness controls, DUDU&rsquo;s elemental readability, Roma&rsquo;s quiet resurrection of Mast&rsquo;s UI bravado, Stella&rsquo;s utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi&rsquo;s odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise&rsquo;s consideration of <em>pace</em>, B4X&rsquo;s unfathomable elements, Ore2&rsquo;s parallel timelines, tooot&rsquo;s development story, and Oyakodon&rsquo;s adorable rough edges that have made my online life <em>measurably</em>&hellip; *immensely- better, these past weeks. At the forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive *control- over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile experiences these applications offer.</p>
<p>Those of you who haven&rsquo;t yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing the fuck out==. I am being *actually- pampered, now, in World Wide Web terms. You are <a href="https://bit.ly/dbmastodon">*so- welcome</a> whenever you&rsquo;re ready - the water is nice and warm, as they say.</p>
<h2 id="party-one">&hellip;Party One</h2>

<p>Yes, you are looking at the currently in-development <strong>&quot;<em>Official</em>&quot; Mastodon app on iOS</strong>, coming very soon to the Awful App Store. You can join me in testing the app right this very moment by contributing to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">the Mastodon Project&rsquo;s Patreon</a>. Though I do plan to publish <a href="https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-app-review"><strong>a dedicated review</strong></a> on its release date, what I&rsquo;ll say for now is that it&rsquo;s very cute, includes *the- most gorgeous media player I&rsquo;ve ever seen on an iOS app, and is as distinctly clever as any of the third-party family we&rsquo;ve just visited, all whilst maintaining an expert&rsquo;s aim at its evangelist purpose.</p>

<p>The surprise that threw me over the edge to a genuinely pitiful extent: the official Mastodon app already includes full <strong>Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts integration on iPhone!</strong></p>

<p><em>Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below&hellip;</em></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For those of us who&rsquo;ve written about technology, generally, for quite a long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/&ldquo;ethical&rdquo; conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an emotional event. <em>The Social Network</em> had an almost comical disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects. Not that it&rsquo;s particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4">said in court</a>, essentially, that he didn&rsquo;t know what the movie was about. I&rsquo;m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em>the times</em>, but <em>documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em>The Social Dilemma</em> could&rsquo;ve done better, in that regard.</p>
<p>First, the <strong>actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell&rsquo;s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man&rsquo;s screen, the film&rsquo;s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em>blatantly false</em> imagery. The Privacy Problem is <em>not</em> that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is <em>ridiculously</em> unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as &ldquo;ridiculous,&rdquo; as did one of my favs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed">Casey Newton</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms"><em>The Verge</em>&rsquo;s official review of the film</a> - written by Adi Robinson and as cited by Casey - is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for <em>The Verge</em>&rsquo;s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly <em>separate</em> tech media - grandmothers, retirees, etc. - who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by <em>The Social Dilemma</em> and particularly susceptible to its delusions about &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; - a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong>collection</strong> of &ldquo;my data,&rdquo; regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong>examination</strong> with human eyes, which - while possible - is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, on to the <strong>notably missing</strong>: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by - and directly promotes on several occasions - one particular organization, called the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/"><em>Center for Humane Technology</em></a>, which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain&hellip; hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who&rsquo;ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages - some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization&rsquo;s website nor the film&rsquo;s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong>the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png" alt="The Social Dilemma Newsletter Prompt"></p>
<p>The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or <em>not</em> using them. What I&rsquo;m here to tell you: <strong>you have a choice of services</strong>. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you&rsquo;ve followed my work for any length of time (you probably shouldn&rsquo;t still be reading,) you know I&rsquo;ve advocated exhaustively for <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> - the open web, decentralized social network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent <a href="https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music">an entire summer</a> arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who&rsquo;s business model benefits both platform and artist. I&rsquo;m still finishing up <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0">a massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook</a>, which has been an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine, namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an open-source and/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the <em>alternatives</em> discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn&rsquo;t immediately off-putting to &ldquo;the average person.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Poke around the film&rsquo;s official website a bit and you&rsquo;ll discover a variety of heavily-branded &ldquo;resources&rdquo; for &ldquo;taking action,&rdquo; all awash with a certain irony, including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view">a fucking Bingo game</a> (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site <em>actually</em> suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the &ldquo;Take Action&rdquo; vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/">tips for reducing your screen time</a>, the &ldquo;<a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/">Data Detox Kit</a>,&rdquo; which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing solution (among an indigestibly huge link tree,) a &ldquo;Join Now&rdquo; button, and - most ironic of all - a link to download the &ldquo;<a href="https://adobserver.org/">Ad Observer plugin</a>,&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;share with researchers the ads you see on social media as they work to expose micro-targeting techniques &amp; hold political advertisers accountable.&rdquo; In other words, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for the &ldquo;Online Political Transparency Project&rdquo; instead of the greater adtech monstrosity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png" alt="The Social Dilemma Bingo"></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a scam. Using <em>The Markup</em>&rsquo;s shiny new <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight tool</a>, I found thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22report.html%22">the report in full</a>.) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no <em>malice</em> in this particular destination, at least, which leaves&hellip; incompetence? I&rsquo;m afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world - regardless of what they believe now, or then - that these folks should not be our first call when we&rsquo;re searching for &ldquo;solutions.&rdquo; You know this, they know it, and they <em>explicitly acknowledged it</em> at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.</p>
<p>Would you care to guess what <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1">Chapter 1</a> of the <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/"><em>Digital Detox Kit</em></a> is about? I can&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;d be correct&hellip; Under the heading &ldquo;CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA,&rdquo; step 1 is literally just <em>renaming your phone</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, you may have “named” your phone for <em>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth</em> or both – or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.</p>
<p>This means that <em>“Alex Chung’s Phone”</em> is what’s visible to the Wi-Fi network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the area who has their Bluetooth on as well.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or airport, so neither should your phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve always considered the ability to change a computer&rsquo;s name an immense privilege. My first &ldquo;real&rdquo; computer&rsquo;s name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that&rsquo;s completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone&rsquo;s common name to that of &ldquo;your favorite television character&rdquo; (<a href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard">Hildur Odegard</a> is my favorite character in <em>Fortitude</em>, so&hellip;) is <em>not</em> bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s <em>ridiculously</em> low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down &ldquo;change device name&rdquo; as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/sEa9ojU.jpeg" alt="Firefox for iOS Notification"></p>
<p><em>A notification I received while literally typing this out.</em></p>
<p>I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I <em>did</em> find an &ldquo;<a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/">Alternative Apps Centre</a>&rdquo; within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the &ldquo;detox&rdquo; seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it&rsquo;s hilarious that I can freely refer to &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the &ldquo;Supported by Mozilla Firefox&rdquo; badges all over the website and asks me &ldquo;well, what did you expect?&rdquo; My answer: something &ldquo;more&rdquo; than promotion, I suppose.</p>
<p>I suspect this is another case of <em>don&rsquo;t go to those who created the problem for the solution</em>. <em>More privacy</em> is a more tangible vector upon which to &ldquo;innovate&rdquo; than simply <em>putting down the fucking phone</em>, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: <strong>turn off all your notifications</strong>. I genuinely believe turning off <em>all</em> notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I&rsquo;d somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for <em>years</em>, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who&rsquo;s notifications I&rsquo;d probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly.</p>
<p>Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just <strong>turn it off</strong>, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I&rsquo;d wager.) I suspect it&rsquo;s long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as &ldquo;<strong>Email Addiction</strong>&rdquo; goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR&rsquo;s greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email&rsquo;s footer. If you&rsquo;re <em>really</em> serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you <em>do</em> read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform&rsquo;s archives feature - or don&rsquo;t - but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you&rsquo;ll be ready to seek out other <em>Email Wellness</em> methodologies like the recently-trendy <em>Inbox Zero</em>.</p>
<p>If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, <strong>a set daily time</strong> to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it&rsquo;s okay to announce on Facebook that you&rsquo;re taking a break from Facebook. There <em>is</em> a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely <strong>contact me literally any time</strong>. My personal phone number is <strong>(573) 823-4380</strong>. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I&rsquo;ve discovered with you.</p>
<p>My own advice on &ldquo;privacy:&rdquo; don&rsquo;t worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the &ldquo;privacy tools&rdquo; you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you&rsquo;re an iOS user, you&rsquo;ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step - if we&rsquo;re really honest with ourselves - is figuring out how you&rsquo;re going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/" title="Thousands Have Joined Mastodon Since Twitter Changed Hands. Its Founder Has a Vision for Democratizing Social Media.">&ldquo;Thousands Have Joined Mastodon Since Twitter Changed Hands. Its Founder Has a Vision for Democratizing Social Media.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Mastodon, a decentralized microblogging site named after an extinct type of mammoth,( recorded 120,000 new users in the four days following billionaire Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, its German-born founder Eugen Rochko tells TIME. Many of them were Twitter users seeking a new place to call their online home.</p>
<p>Those users, whether they knew it or not, were following in the footsteps of Rochko, 29, who began coding Mastodon in 2016 after becoming disillusioned with Twitter. “I was thinking that being able to express myself online to my friends through short messages was very important to me, important also to the world, and that maybe it should not be in the hands of a single corporation,” Rochko says. “It was generally related to a feeling of distrust of the top down control that Twitter exercised.”</p>
<p>Mastodon, which proudly proclaims it is [“not for sale”] and has around [4.5 million] user accounts, is pretty similar to Twitter, once users get past the complicated sign-up process. The main difference is that it’s not one cohesive platform, but actually a collection of different, independently-run and self-funded servers. Users on different servers can still communicate with each other, but anybody can set up their own server, and set their own rules for discussion. Mastodon is a crowdfunded nonprofit, which funds the full-time work of Rochko—its sole employee—and several popular servers.</p>
<p>The platform doesn’t have the power to force server owners to do anything—even comply with basic content moderation standards. That sounds like a recipe for an online haven for far-right trolls. But in practice, many of Mastodon’s servers have stricter rules than Twitter, Rochko says. When hate-speech servers do appear, other servers can band together to block them, essentially ostracizing them from the majority of the platform. “I guess you could call it the democratic process,” Rochko says.</p>
<p>The recent influx from Twitter, Rochko says, has been a vindication. “It is a very positive thing to find that your work is finally being appreciated and respected and more widely known,” he says. “I have been working very, very hard to push the idea that there is a better way to do social media than what the commercial companies like Twitter and Facebook allow.”</p>
<p>TIME spoke with Rochko on Oct. 31.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think of what Elon Musk is doing at Twitter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know. The man is not entirely comprehensible. I don’t agree with a lot of his behaviors and his decision-making. I think that buying Twitter was an impulse decision that he soon regretted. And that he basically got himself into a situation that kind of forced him to commit to the deal. And now he’s in it, and he has to deal with the fallout.</p>
<p>I specifically disagree with his stance on free speech, because I think that it depends on your interpretation of what free speech means. If you allow the most intolerant voices to be as loud as they want to, you’re going to shut down voices of different opinions as well. So allowing free speech by just allowing all speech is not actually leading to free speech, it just leads to a cesspit of hate.</p>
<p>I think that is a very uniquely American idea of creating this marketplace of ideas where you can say anything you want completely without limits. It is very foreign to the German mindset where we, in our Constitution, our number one priority is maintaining human dignity. And so, hate speech is not part of the German concept of free speech, for example. So I think that when Elon Musk says that everything’s gonna be allowed, or whatever, I generally disagree with that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you ensure on Mastodon, given that it’s decentralized and you don’t have the power to ban users, that the space is welcoming and safe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, this is the kind of strange dichotomy of how it’s turned out. On the one hand, the technology itself is what allows basically anyone to host their own independent social media server, and to basically be able to do anything they want with it. There is no way for Mastodon, the company, or anyone really—except the normal law enforcement procedures—to really go after anyone specifically running a Mastodon server. The way that you would shut down a normal web site is how you would shut down a Mastodon server, there’s no difference there. So on that end, it kind of turns out to be the ultimate free speech platform. But obviously that’s basically just a side effect of creating a tool that can be used by anyone. It’s kind of like cars. Cars are used by everyone, even bad people, even for bad purposes, there’s nothing you can do about it, because the tool is out there. However, I think that the differentiating factor to something like Twitter or Facebook, is that on Mastodon, when you host your own server, you can also decide what rules you want to enforce on that server, which allows communities to create safer spaces than they could otherwise have on these large platforms that are interested in serving as many people as possible, perhaps driving engagement up on purpose to increase time people spend on the web.</p>
<p>You can have communities that have much stricter rules than Twitter has. And in practice, a lot of them are stricter. And this is part of where, again, the technology intersects with guidance or leadership from Mastodon the company. I think that, through the way that we communicate publicly, we have avoided attracting a crowd of the kind of people who you would find on Parler or Gab, or whatever other internet hate forums. Instead we’ve attracted the kind of people who would moderate against hate speech when running their own servers. Additionally, we also act as a guide for anyone who wants to join. Because on our website, and our apps, we provide a default list of curated servers that people can make accounts on. And through that, we make sure that we curate the list in such a way that any server that wants to be promoted by us has to agree to a certain basic set of rules, one of which is that no hate speech is allowed, no sexism, no racism, no homophobia, or transphobia. And through that, we ensure that the association between Mastodon, the brand, and the experience that people want is that of a much safer space than something like Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what happens if you hateful people do set up a server?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, obviously, they don’t get promoted on our “Join Mastodon” website or in our app. So whatever they do, they do on their own and completely separately, and the other administrators that run their own Mastodon servers, when they find out that there’s a new hate speech server, they may decide that they don’t want to receive any messages from the server and block it on their end. Through, I guess you could call it the democratic process, the hateful server can get ostracized or can get split off into basically, a little echo chamber, which is, I guess, no better or worse than them being in some other echo chamber. The internet is full of spam. It’s full of abuse, of course. Mastodon provides the facilities necessary to deal with unwanted content, both on the user end and on the operator end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What made you want to go into building a service like this back in 2016?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember that I was just not very happy with Twitter, and I was worried where it was going to go from there. Something very questionable was in its future. That got me thinking that, you know, being able to express myself online to my friends through short messages was actually very important to me, important also to the world, and that maybe it should not be in the hands of a single corporation that can just do whatever it wants with it. I started working on my own thing. I called it Mastodon because I’m not good at naming things. I just chose whatever came to my mind at the time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There was obviously no ambition of going big with it at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must feel pretty special to see something that you made grow from nothing to where it is now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it is. It is a very positive thing to find that your work is finally being appreciated and respected and more widely known. I’ve been fighting for this for a long time, I started working on Mastodon in 2016, back then I had no ambitions of it going far at all. It was very much a hobbyist project at the start, then when I launched publicly it seemed to strike a chord with at least the tech community and that’s when I got the original Patreon supporters that allowed me to take on this job full time. And from then on I have been working very, very hard to make this platform as accessible and as easy to use for everyone as possible. And to push the idea forward, that there is a better way to do social media than what the commercial companies like Twitter and Facebook allow.</p>

			 <p>Wild rumor claims macOS 14 is coming to the M2 iPad Pro
That would certainly shake things up.
By Michael Simon Executive Editor, Macworld Oct 21, 2022 9:13 am PDT
News</p>
<p>Michael SImon / IDG
File this one under Too Crazy to Ignore: A leaker on Twitter claims that Apple is working on a “smaller version of macOS” that will run “exclusively” on the new M2 iPad Pro next year.
We’re with you—there are a lot of reasons to be skeptical. For one, the leaker, Majin Bu, doesn’t have much of a track record beyond case leaks and the yet-to-be-confirmed 14-inch iPad. For another, there’s very little evidence that Apple is working to merge the iPad and Mac lines other than the two sharing the same Stage Manager feature in iPadOS 16 and Ventura. And finally, limiting such a dramatic change to a single iPad Pro model would raise the ire of many users.</p>
<p>According with my source Apple would be testing a smaller version of macOS exclusively for the new iPad Pro M2!
&ldquo;Mendocino&rdquo; should be the codename for macOS 14. A simplified version should be planned for the M2.
But still, it’s an interesting, if not exciting rumor. The iPad Pro remains a device with untapped potential, with a screaming fast processor, stunning ProMotion display, Thunderbolt, and Face ID. However, while there are a few features in iPadOS 16 that are exclusive to M1-powered iPads, Apple hasn’t really elevated the iPad Pro above its other less-expensive iPads.
Bu claims that the “simplified” version of macOS 14 will have “a 25% larger macOS UI” that’s presumably optimized for touch. But since iPadOS already supports trackpad navigation with the Magic Keyboard, the general macOS experience wouldn’t need to change. And now that Apple has added Stage Manager to both iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura, there’s something of a unified navigation system as well.
So maybe it’s not so crazy. As it stands there aren’t a ton of reasons to buy an iPad Pro over an iPad Air, and a “lite” version of macOS would absolutely shake things up in a big way. We won’t know if this rumor is true until Apple uvneils the next version of macOS at WWDC in June—or until Mark Gurman or Ming-Chi Kuo corroborates it—but for now, we’re happy to keep dreaming.</p>

<p>My first and only dedicated mp3 player was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod_shuffle.html"><strong>a first-generation iPod Shuffle</strong></a> - which was not only the most elegant looking USB drive one could find at the time, but - imo - remains the single highest-value mainstream consumer tech product I’ve ever owned. It was a 512mb stick with playback controls and a 3.5mm audio jack at one end. From what I remember, you could just freely store any combination of non-media files and media files in the root separated by a single directory. I was in 5th grade (11 years old) at the time (2005,) and public schools were just beginning to suggest students invest in a flash drive for carrying/storing digital school assignments.</p>
<p>I say <em>highest value</em> because got dang was that thing handy. Idk if I can communicate it, really, but it unified so many functions into one very high quality (and extremely tough) device. (I accidentally put it through the wash at least 3 separate times and it never actually stopped working.) It even came with a lanyard attachment!</p>
<p>Idk if there’s something wrong with me or what but I’m especially sentimental about this thing because I remember wholeheartedly believing and anticipating tech to progress along these lines - design priorities that especially made sense to me. Clever, lean permutations/amalgamations of once single-function products&hellip;.</p>
<p>I took that photo during a tech podcast years ago - I was doing this same anecdote lol. I find it to be the best idea Apple, Incorporated ever had and yet looking at the everymac page now, I see it was discontinued less than 9 months after it came out. :cry:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It feels a bit ironic – and perhaps somewhat sad, too – to pick a third-party Twitter client for this section of MacStories Weekly given everything that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">happening to the service</a> <em>literally as we speak</em>. However, given the possibility of lights going out for third-party Twitter clients in the near future, I figured I’d talk about an app I’ve been using for the past few months that has fundamentally changed – and improved – my usage of Twitter. The app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spring-for-twitter/id1508706541">Spring</a>, and it’s the most powerful and customizable Twitter client you can find on Apple platforms right now.</p>
<p>Spring has been around for a long time, but I only started paying attention to it a few months ago when I went looking for modern alternatives to Tweetbot that rely on the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api">latest generation of the Twitter API</a>. I was so impressed by Spring and its native approach to Twitter on iPhone, iPad, and Mac for power users of the service, it didn’t take me long to fully embrace it as my go-to client for my everyday usage of Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/2fded105eb.png" alt="Spring 4 beta with support for multiple windows and the new ‘Divide View’."></p>
<p>Spring is a rare combination of a native experience that uses all the latest and greatest Apple APIs combined with the modern Twitter API. If you’re a heavy iPad user, you’ll be happy to know this is the kind of modern app where you can find keyboard shortcuts, context menus, and support for multiple windows, which open as <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/7/#center-windows">Center Windows in Split View</a> and regular windows in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/stage-manager-ipados-16-1-review/">Stage Manager</a>. These features carry over to the Mac version as well (Spring is a Universal app), but I wanted to mention the iPad app because it’s still uncommon to find a truly-desktop class experience that fundamentally understands all the latest frameworks available on iPadOS. Obviously, every button in Spring supports hover effects with the pointer and, as a result, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/ipad-and-ipad-pro-review-2022/#apple-pencil-hover-as-a-ui-input-method">Apple Pencil Hover on the latest iPad Pros</a>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, every aspect of Spring feels up to date with Apple’s latest offerings: you’ll also find custom icons, support for Dynamic Text, context menus that have nested sub-menus, various Accessibility options, multiple accent colors for the app’s themes, push notifications, and – the big one – timeline sync based on iCloud. If you, like me, have never been able to kick the timeline completionist habit from your daily Twitter consumption, Spring has you covered there.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/0cf9cffc9c.png" alt="Context menus in Spring."></p>
<p>Indie developer Junyu Kuang – the sole creator of Spring – tried to integrate with as many native Apple APIs just as much as they added support for Twitter’s latest enhancements to the third-party API. This is the other part of Spring I love. Spring is the only third-party Twitter client I’ve found that tries to “complete” threads in the main timeline just like the Twitter official app and website do, meaning that you’ll always see the original tweet alongside a reply to it in your timeline for additional context. Not everybody likes this, which is why this option is a setting, but this is one of my favorite aspects of the official Twitter timeline, and I’m very happy to have it in a client that doesn’t show me ads or other promoted tweets. In the latest beta version of Spring on TestFlight (which anyone can sign up for from the app’s About screen or by clicking this <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/9JJ8kwj0">link</a>), Spring has added support for viewing edited tweets and their edited history as well as tweets containing mixed media. If the Twitter API continues to operate as normal, I’m sure the Spring developer will figure out ways to integrate with the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/blog/product-news/2022/new-v2-direct-messages-endpoints">latest DM enhancements</a> too.</p>
<p>The third pillar of Spring is its wild amount of customization options. It can be overwhelming at first, but if you’re the kind of user who likes to fine-tune all the possible aspects of a Twitter client, prepare to have fun with Spring. If you can think of something you’d like to tweak in the app, it’s likely there’s already a setting for it.</p>
<p>For starters, the tab bar is completely customizable: you can choose how many items you want to show in it, change their names and icons via SF Symbols and, more importantly, you can create your own tabs. This is one of the key concepts of Spring: anything can become a custom view in the app and turned into a permanent tab for future access. Do you have <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/using-a-twitter-saved-search-to-read-replies-mentions-and-quoted-tweets-in-a-single-view/">an advanced Twitter search you always use</a>? It can become a view. A profile you always check? It can be a view. A list? Same deal. You get the idea. This degree of personalization is unprecedented for Twitter clients on Apple platforms, and it’s the part of the Spring experience I enjoy the most.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/6ed6b92513.png" alt="Custom views in Spring and the app’s Profile view."></p>
<p>Even better: in the upcoming version 4.0 of Spring, you’ll be able to open any view as a custom, in-app split-screen mode that works in tandem with multi-windowing on iPad but is also supported on the iPhone.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/bdf2446f41.png" alt="The ‘Divide View’ in the Spring 4 beta, which anyone can sign up for."></p>
<p>The customization features offered by Spring go way deeper than this though. Context menus are entirely customizable and you can choose the order of options in the menus as well as disable the ones you never use. You can choose and re-arrange the inline tweet actions you see displayed underneath tweets in any view of the app. There are dozens of appearance settings, settings for media playback, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/60ecf4d69b.png" alt="Customizing menus in Spring."></p>
<p>Lastly, Spring is the kind of app whose experience is also defined by the plethora of small features that, when considered all together, contribute to this feeling of “total control” over your timeline. Unlike other clients, Spring lets you view tweet statistics and check out who liked or retweeted a tweet. You can select text on images with Live Text. There is a ‘Copy Link’ button that you can pin to the tweet action bar to speed up the process of copying tweet links to your clipboard. When you share a tweet with the share sheet, there’s even a custom menu that lets you choose whether you want to share its link, text, author, or a screenshot of it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dieselgoth.micro.blog/uploads/2022/eedc99ec49.png" alt="Options for sharing tweets in Spring."></p>
<p>Like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471">Drafts</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvis-pro/id1447768809">Marvis</a>, and other highly-customizable apps that we frequently cover at MacStories, it’s impossible to sum up a powerful, desktop-class experience such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spring-for-twitter/id1508706541">Spring</a> in a single section of a newsletter. Hopefully, however, my description of Spring has given you an idea of what you can expect from the app, which is going to receive a massive 4.0 soon that we’ll cover with a separate story.</p>
<p>Personally, Spring has been one of my favorite discoveries of 2022, and I already know it’s going to be a serious contender for my favorite app of the year. If you’ve been feeling bored with your current Twitter client and would like to try something new, I can’t recommend Spring enough. Now we just need to hope Twitter’s new leadership doesn’t decide to discontinue the third-party API like they did with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover-11666918031">the company’s former executives</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I want to close out this section by covering the most surprising addition to the Reminders app this year: templates. In Reminders for iOS 16, you can turn any list into a template that you can reuse yourself or share as an iCloud link with others. To do this, select the new ‘Save as Template’ button in a list’s menu; you can give your template a name and, optionally, choose to include completed tasks in it or not. Once you’ve got a template saved, you’ll be able to use it as a starting point when creating a new list in Reminders.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/KTswhjQC.png" alt="Saving a list as a template."></p>
<p>The addition of templates opens up a lot of fascinating use cases for the Reminders app. At a basic level, you can save your classic packing checklist or YouTube video project as templates so, the next time you’re packing for a trip or are about to publish a video, you can quickly set up a list with the same series of tasks you need to complete. This kind of personal usage is in itself useful, and it’s surprising because it’s typically an advanced feature you find in more pro-oriented task managers. At any point, you can even edit your template and add new reminders to it without modifying the original list it was based on.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AvAmPzPk.png" alt="Editing a template without modifying the original list it was based on."></p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/uQRwg08G.png" alt="When creating a new list, you now have the option to start from a template."></p>
<p>What’s going to be interesting, however, is the shared aspect of templates. When you share a template as a link with someone else, the recipient will be able to add it to their Reminders app and see all tasks exactly as you formatted them. I think you see where this is going. Reminders supports dates, tags, images, rich links, subtasks, priorities, and flags; in iOS 16, shared templates support all these pieces of metadata with the exception of image attachments, which will be removed when sharing a template with someone else.16 This means that you can now use a Reminders template to, say, share media recommendations for TV shows or movies; you can set up a template that’s a guide to a city with links for places to visit and restaurants to check out; you can create a template for a book club with direct links to the Apple Books store, and so forth.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/qIUUQQeJ.png" alt="An example of a template for locations to check out in Rome."></p>
<p>I don’t foresee relying on templates for my own use of the Reminders app, but I’m intrigued by their potential in a shared environment. The Reminders team keeps on knocking it out of the park with their app updates every year; I’m keen to see how they’ll build upon all these features introduced in iOS 16.</p>

Is there any way to get to the &quot;Screen Time → See All Activity&quot; screen for family members?  I see them listed on the screen below, but haven't been able to guess a path value that works.
What’s the exact path to get to a family member’s See All Activity screen manually? I know how to get to See All Activity for my own device, but I don’t have an iCloud family that I can test with.

That's the part I'm struggling with.  I had assumed / hoped that the See All Activity part would be easy once I could get to the Family Member view.
 *[※](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls/issues/10#issuecomment-810319059)‑[bcmitri](https://github.com/bcmitri)*

I meant, what’s the series of taps to get there? Ignoring the search for a URL for a moment.

Oh...  It’s just the name of my family member from the main Screen Time view.

What if you URL encode the family member’s name exactly as it appears on screen there, and then use that as the path?

To encode the name as a url, I assume I just replace the space with a %20.  Is that right?  If so, I've tried that, and it just brings me to the main Screen Time view.
 *[※](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls/issues/10#issuecomment-810331841)‑[bcmitri](https://github.com/bcmitri)*

---
Sounds about right, assuming there’s no other characters that would need to be percent encoded.

Are there any other identifiers that could possibly be used as paths? I’m at a loss.

Really, there's just the screen that you see above.  Clicking my family member's name brings me to the main Screen Time view for that family member.

No worries if you don't know the answer.  I just thought I'd ask.

Hmm, all right. I’ll leave this issue open and hope that it gets an answer someday, since this would be a particularly useful one.

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/EQ4GSUGH.png" alt="Terminology URL Scheme and Vocabulary Workspace"></p>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/terminology">my app store review of Terminology</a> (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular dictionary apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448">LookUp</a> (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to <em>add new terms</em> that don’t show up in search results. Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since found out to be the cause of <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328">its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328</a></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859">Terminology</a> <em>does</em> support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to form the workflow you see demonstrated in <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/165031796-5df78c01-faee-4fd4-84d0-f0bf95fd383f.MOV">the video below</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/Q04Kxrg">https://imgur.com/gallery/Q04Kxrg</a></p>
<p>First, I use the <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1CS">Lookup in Terminology action</a> paired with a keyboard shortcut (<code>^⇧D</code>) in Drafts to search a selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and - if needed - add a definition via the notes button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button - “[Drafts-definition](terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0
terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&amp;shortName=Drafts&amp;description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&amp;urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&amp;dispatchType=0)” - (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term <em>including its notes</em> back to Drafts with the following configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]
</code></pre><p>That button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/K0adnLf5.png" alt="Antagonistic Vocabulary Draft Example"></p>
<p>I then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the process and placing it within the parameters defined by <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/w/1zN">my Vocabulary workspace</a>, which shows only drafts with that tag, sorted alphabetically.</p>
<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been wreaking havoc on NeoCities’ global activity feed using <a href="https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities">the action group I created</a> on <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts">the /drafts directory</a> of davidblue dot wtf. Specifically, the action that uploads HTML files to that directory named by the UUID of the draft. (Here’s <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/F20BB579-E235-4F04-8BCE-22AAF15A97C2.html">the corresponding link for this post</a>, for example.) With consequent <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#identifier-tags">draft_open_urls</a> left in the footer of each as per my current, more or less universal <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/template/1.4.txt">HTML template</a>, I’m able to immediately open the appropriate draft locally.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/2npm338t.png" alt="Vocabulary Index Shortcut"></p>
<p>In order to maintain <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/vocabulary">an updated index</a> of the whole list, I’ve created <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/113f8e45729c4466860c3c7c668e939d">a Siri Shortcut</a> which transforms the UUIDs of the drafts in the vocabulary workspace into markdown-formatted hyperlinks of their web-dwelling counterparts.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/D8GtXEd3.png" alt="Terminology Favorites List"></p>
<p>Even if you’ve no intention of publishing your personal vocabulary - or integrating it with Drafts - Terminology is still the dictionary app I’d recommend over any others.</p>

<p>The author, on a good day.</p>
<p>Matt Gemmell<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a writer of thriller, horror, and suspense novels. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland with his wife Lauren, their son Calum, and the world’s most handsome labradoodle, Whisky. You can <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/books/">find out about his books here</a>.</p>
<p>He developed a fascination with fiction as a young boy, and first tried his hand at writing <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/my-stories/">stories of his own</a> in his early teens. Writing fell by the wayside for a while, and Matt got a degree in Computing Science then had a successful career as a software engineer, including design and user experience consultancy for companies like Apple. He also released software of his own, and <a href="https://github.com/mattgemmell/">contributed significantly</a> to the open source community.</p>
<p><img src="https://mattgemmell.com/images/whisky.jpg" alt="Whisky the labradoodle"></p>
<p>Whisky, <em>without</em> an &lsquo;e&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Life rolled on, including marriage to Lauren, his university sweetheart, and in the opening days of 2014, Matt decided to <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/">make some changes</a> and try pursuing novel-writing in earnest. The <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/books/kestrel/">KESTREL techno-thrillers series</a> was born, with many other stories besides, and the journey continues.</p>
<p>Matt is also the author of the <em>Once Upon A Time</em> collections of ultra-short tales, including <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/books/once-upon-a-time/">ebooks and paperback anthologies</a>, and a continuing <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/books/once-upon-a-time/stories/">series of standalone stories</a> which you can <a href="https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/n2d2u9">receive free via email every week</a>.</p>

<h1 id="personality-report">Personality Report</h1>
<p>One of the most prominent themes in the lives of January 27 people is that of early development, as those born on this day often manifest their talents at an early age. Not infrequently their professions are related to the same theme, and may deal directly or indirectly with young people. January 27 people are usually highly concerned with what is new and keeping young themselves.</p>
<p>One associated problem often encountered by January 27 people is that of premature development—obviously the greatest danger in childhood is that they be exploited or pushed too fast. Not infrequently their projects develop too quickly, their ideas manifest too suddenly, their financial affairs expand too precipitously.</p>
<p>Because those born on this day are psychologically predisposed to speedy decisions, it may be very difficult for them to maintain control over their affairs. In their interpersonal relationships, as well, they may push both friendships and romantic attachments too quickly, thus creating an uncomfortable, albeit exciting situation for the other person involved. Sweeping others off their feet with a kind of tumultuous energy is typical of January 27 people.</p>
<p>Above all, those born on this day must learn patience and discrimination. Not all of their work is of the highest calibre, though they expect it to be and can firmly believe it is. Unless January 27 people pay careful attention to the opinions and reactions of others they may suffer disappointment and rejection. In addition they must learn not only what they can do, but also who they are. Cultivating a realistic outlook toward life is essential for them if they wish to be successful in the world.</p>
<p>For January 27 people, keeping their childlike nature satisfied can be a full time job in itself. They may be accused more than once in their lives of being overenthusiastic, juvenile, childish or even infantile in their emotional attitudes. All maturing experiences—having children themselves, conjugal sex, sharing household duties and responsibilities, holding a job, are both a challenge and opportunity for growth. If those born on this day get stuck in any of the developmental stages of childhood, they run the risk of being an eternal Peter Pan, i.e., never growing up. As charming a role as this may seem, it can wear thin when they find themselves in middle age.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that January 27 people undergo maturity crises at the ages of twenty-eight, thirty-six or forty-two, when they are faced by stark choices as to whether they wish to fully accept adult responsibilities or not. Such decisions can only be made by the January 27 person him/herself and cannot be forced. Those born on this day must come to realize that retaining youth need not conflict with a maturing and strengthening of character. Working with children and young people, starting new projects and studying the process of learning and creativity can all help to sustain their youthful needs in a healthy fashion.</p>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>Those born on January 27 may be prone to various childhood maladies, some of which can spell lasting difficulties into their adult life. Therefore, parents who have children born on this day must take special care to treat their illnesses swiftly and intelligently. Later in life January 27 people are particularly prone to difficulties with their nervous and circulatory systems, which may in fact be related to each other. Keeping themselves in good shape with a sensible, down-to-earth, varied diet and seeing that they get proper dietary supplements is a great help. In addition, regular physical exercise in the open air is essential, whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="numerology">Numerology</h3>
<p>Those born on the 27th of the month are ruled by the number 9 (2+7=9), and by the planet Mars. The number 9 is powerful in its influence on other numbers (any number added to 9 yields that number (e.g., 5+9=14, 4+1=5) and any number multiplied by 9 yields a 9 (e.g., 9x5=45, 4+5=9). The planet Mars is forceful and aggressive, and Number 9 people thus have the capacity to envelop situations. The combination of Mars with Uranus (ruler of Aquarius) can indicate marked mental abilities but leave January 27 people cool or unemotional most of the time, with periodic, and often childish, outbursts.</p>
<h3 id="tarot">Tarot</h3>
<p>The 9th card of the Major Arcana is The Hermit, who is usually depicted walking with a lantern and a stick—he represents meditation, isolation and quietude. The Hermit also signifies crystallized wisdom and ultimate discipline. The Hermit is a taskmaster who motivates by conscience and guides others on their path. The positive indications of this card are stick-to-it-iveness, purpose, profundity and concentration; negative qualities include dogmatism, intolerance, mistrust and discouragement. For January 27 people, the negative characteristics are a warning to those who would hold on to past accomplishments and fail to mature.</p>

<li><strong>UNIQUE</strong></li>
<li><strong>SELF‑TAUGHT</strong></li>
<li><strong>DISTRACTED</strong></li>
<li><strong>RECKLESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>STRESSED‑OUT</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advice-1">Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clarify a realistic picture of yourself in your mind’s eye.</li>
<li>A certain amount of undesirable personal interaction is always necessary; try to be a bit more thick-skinned, and if necessary, downright insensitive.</li>
<li>Cultivate calm, patience and persistence rather than always going your own way.</li>
<li>Learn to handle frustration and be tough enough to quietly demand the very best for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Although those born during the Week of Genius may not necessarily be more intelligent than others in the year, they generally learn quickly and exhibit an alert, even high-strung demeanor. Like thoroughbreds, they are hot-blooded types, usually champing at the bit to get on with it. Patience is not one of their virtues, and they show a marked itchiness with those slower sorts who need time to express themselves and make decisions.</p>
<p>They often arouse other people’s amazement, and also jealousy, due to the speed and ease with which they pick things up at the first go. When they are young, this ability may manifest as precocity, but parents and teachers who do not understand them may criticize them as superficial, and for lacking the staying power to see a project through. But although it is true that they are easily bored, they are quite capable of perseverance when they feel it is warranted. Not all of them have the ability to learn so fast, but most value mental skills highly and try to develop them, whether natural or not. They also prize education, but not always the kind found in school: they believe that experience is the best teacher and are often self-taught. The lure of worldly excitement will often entice them away from the classroom, and travel to foreign lands can have a peculiar fascination for them.</p>
<p>In their careers, they want to have things their own way. They rarely do well in jobs where they are told what to do. Self-employment or independent positions suit them better, particularly if their work allows them the freedom to make choices, plan, change direction, follow their instincts and be true to what they believe. Although they can be excellent leaders, whether of families and social groups or in their professional environments, they have no essential need to either rule or dominate. Their greatest need in relation to other people may actually be just the need for attention, since every performer ultimately needs an audience.</p>
<p>It is extremely important for them to give every project they work on their own personal stamp. People who enjoy the individual expression of others are fond of them, but their often destabilizing and self-centered energies can affect group projects adversely. They often seem rebellious, but this is usually because of some attempt to tame or control them. Their impulsiveness can easily bring them into conflict with authority figures, or with those of a more conservative nature.</p>
<p>Once they accept their uniqueness and realize that their social needs and drives are less deep than they think, they will make great strides in their careers. The more enlightened may come to realize they can use their strengths best by pursuing a career that does not necessarily involve social contact. There are many areas of science, music, art, publishing or economics that can fit the bill. Part of the problem they confront in working with others is that they tend to exhaust their talents and energies on those close to them, sometimes in a frustrated effort to fit in and feel that they really belong to a group.</p>
<p>On the negative side, they have a tendency toward self-destructiveness. They are more hurtful to themselves than to others. They can be emotionally unstable, and at times can appear distracted, wired, self-absorbed, and can be easily upset. Their sensitivity to external stimuli may be pronounced in such moods, and they may have an acute need to withdraw to a quiet place, away from the bustle of the world. Easily stressed out, even prone to periodic breakdowns, they must learn to toughen themselves. If they can become less easily aroused, they will deal more effectively with the exigencies of everyday life.</p>
<p>In matters of love, they insist that their mates understand their need for freedom. They will not be tied down to fixed routines and schedules. Friends and lovers with more demanding expectations of them are in for a rude surprise; rarely will they accept restriction. Chafing at constraint, they may just try to find another free spirit to get involved with, a solution that may work in the short term but seldom provides the stability and permanence required for deeper commitment. Some may indeed desire a permanent, faithful, giving and stable partner but may also seek the freedom to carry on all kinds of other relationships, sexual or otherwise, at the same time. By practicing this kind of double standard, these people seek to satisfy both their needs and their desires, but they also show their disregard for others.</p>
<p>Those born during the Week of Genius who choose family life will have to learn to direct their energies efficiently, share responsibilities, budget their time and, above all, conquer their need for attention. Their charismatic side often attracts the wrong kind of people, and this may keep their energy from those whom they love and who really need it, particularly family members. Restricting themselves to a well-chosen circle of close friends, and concentrating on those who have a stabilizing effect on them psychologically and are not needy people, will contribute greatly to their happiness.</p>

<h3 id="sun">Sun</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun determines your ego, identity, and &ldquo;role&rdquo; in life. It&rsquo;s the core of who you are, and is the sign you&rsquo;re most likely to already know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Sun is in <strong>Aquarius</strong>, meaning you are fundamentally unconventional and anti. Comfortable dissenting or straying from the norm, your intellectual talent of abstraction is oriented towards pushing the boundaries of what seems reasonable. You carry a lot on your shoulders and have need to fight for the underdog. It&rsquo;s in your seventh house, meaning you feel the need to distinguish yourself from others through close relationships and long-term partnerships.</p>
<h3 id="ascendant">Ascendant</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your ascendant is the &ldquo;mask&rdquo; you present to people. It can be seen in your personal style and how you come off to people when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as you get older. It changes every two hours, so if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, text your mom to confirm your birth time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Ascendant is in <strong>Leo</strong>, meaning you come across as bright, good-natured, and magnetic. Your energy makes you seem either like a know-it-all or a live wire—but always the center of attention.</p>
<h3 id="moon">Moon</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your personality when you&rsquo;re alone or deeply comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Moon is in <strong>Leo</strong>, meaning your emotional self is dramatic, proud, expressive, idealistic, and somewhat self-centered. You need a lot of love, care, and validation from other people. It&rsquo;s in your first house, meaning you find security and safety through your self and self-image—and, because it&rsquo;s your first house, your Moon in Leo is hyper-present in your personality.</p>
<h3 id="mercury">Mercury</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercury determines how you communicate, talk, think, and process information. It also indicates how you learn. It is the mind&rsquo;s planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Mercury is in <strong>Aquarius</strong>, meaning your intellect is insightful, unconventional, and super meta. You have a rich imagination that allows you to think in a way that is abstracted from daily life. You enjoy intellectual banter, though you sometimes push your ideas on others. It&rsquo;s in your seventh house, meaning you are curious about and inclined to analyze your closest relationships and how they affect you.</p>
<h3 id="venus">Venus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Venus determines how and what you love. It indicates how you express affection and the qualities you&rsquo;re attracted to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Venus is in <strong>Aquarius</strong>, meaning your romantic side is unconventional, intellectual, and somewhat detached. You can be bubbly and obvious when you like someone, but typically you prefer forms of intimacy less obvious than romance. It&rsquo;s in your seventh house, meaning that for you, love is often expressed in close relationships and long-term partnerships.</p>
<h3 id="mars">Mars</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mars is the planet of aggression. It determines how you assert yourself, take action, and the energy that surrounds you—particularly in your sex life, your ambitiousness, and when you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Mars is in <strong>Capricorn</strong>, meaning you assert yourself in a way that is responsible and efficient, and you think things through very intentionally. Highly motivated by ambition, your rationality sometimes seems soulless. It&rsquo;s in your sixth house, meaning you put a lot of energy into routines.</p>
<h3 id="uranus">Uranus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Uranus stays in each sign for seven years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules innovation, rebellion, and progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Uranus is in <strong>Capricorn</strong>, meaning other generations are shocked by your generation&rsquo;s sense of responsibility, seriousness, rationality, and hunger for power. It&rsquo;s in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in rebelling against dated expectations about routines.</p>
<h3 id="neptune">Neptune</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Neptune stays in each sign for around fourteen years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules dreams, imagination, and the unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Neptune is in <strong>Capricorn</strong>, meaning your entire generation finds inspiration through hard work, responsibility, seriousness, and ambition. It&rsquo;s in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in your ideal—verging on unrealistic and impractical—about routines.</p>
<h3 id="pluto">Pluto</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pluto stays in each sign for up to thirty years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules power, intensity, obsession, and control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Pluto is in <strong>Scorpio</strong>, meaning your generation&rsquo;s psyche is comparatively passionate, intense, serious, private, self-obsessed, and perceptive. It&rsquo;s in your fifth house, meaning you personally are transforming outdated definitions of romance, creativity, and pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="bewildering---aquarius-sun-leo-moon"><em>Bewildering</em> - Aquarius Sun, Leo Moon</h2>
<p>The combination of Aquarius Sun and Leo Moon signs produces the sort of personality that is always there to help people in need; a true humanitarian. Because this trait is so strong in your nature, you’re a bit of an easy mark for con men or other friends and family that would take advantage. You are the one people come to when they have problems and need help. You are proud, independent, and self-reliant, and you don’t like to have your original good opinion of people upset. Because of this, you keep a bad bargain and perhaps stay with a relationship that has gone sour. There are times, thanks to your deeply emotional but expansive and friendly nature, that you need to be hard-headed and practical in dealing with people, particularly in handling people making demands on your time or money.</p>
<p>This combination blends the originality and independence of Aquarius with the emotional warmth and confidence of Leo. Born near a full Moon, you possess the inclination to project your personality into the world or affairs. Sensitive and affectionate, marriage strongly influences your life. Naturally friendly, you have a great capacity for kindness and sympathy, and you love very deeply. Sometimes romantic interests may cloud your judgment and ability for practical action. Just the same, these are both fixed signs, and you are very hard to convince against your will.</p>
<p>You follow your inner feelings and can be positive and determined when you feel you are right. As a leader, you employ a style of warm and affection rather than by using more stern and harsher methods. You have a tendency to be impulsive and jump to conclusions, often making decisions without due forethought.</p>
<p>Principle means a great deal to you and you are strongly influenced by this and by your feelings, affections, and emotions. Success comes most easily, however, when you can keep your emotions under the control of your intellect.</p>
<p>Common to every Aquarius-Leo is confusion about who you are or who you should be. However most finally resolve their difficulties by striking a balance. Instead of denying yourself the rank and authority you long for, you will pursue an ambitious life. Nevertheless, you will always remain thoughtful and sympathetic in your dealings with others. You are a nice individual, a friend to everyone, and you treat others as equals because of your Aquarian nature. However your Leo inner self is solid, dignified, and controlling. In actual fact, you want to be the leader and exercise that authority.</p>
<p>You waver between assertiveness and over- accommodation, authority and compliance, but you want to be loved and valued by everyone, which often holds you back. The two signs of your combination are totally different in essence and character, which gives you a multifaceted personality with many inner battles. Your combination indicates great force, dedication, and purposefulness as well as a lot of intelligence. You are always unsure of whether to rely on your heart or your mind, but decision making may be hard for you.</p>
<p>As with all Aquarians, you see things from a separate, intellectual perspective. However, because your Leo inner nature is very emotional, your heart nearly always has the last word in your life. Many Aquarius-Leos are attracted to the metaphysical and occult and are frequently members of religious cults offering instant salvation. Your extraordinary imagination and self-governing spirit need a constructive outlet for expression. Both of your signs are fixed signs so you must be careful that obstinacy, arrogance, and bigotry do not stand in your path to success. Like all Leos you long for admiration and attention and you have a strong sense of the theatrical, but your sporadic ostentation and kookiness are often funny.</p>
<p>You are prone to behaving on sudden, random hunches because you are impulsive. Unfortunately this often turns out to be catastrophic. Finally, through trial and error, you do well in anything you try, even though you are forgetful and absentminded. You do learn from experience. Dedication is one of your preferred words. Devoted and honest, you are not happy until you have mastered whatever you do. Your youth was probably a disaster or limited in some way. Senseless revolt and inner chaos, especially in your youth, may have been the result.</p>

<p>The Tumblr API is implemented over standard HTTP requests. This allows Tumblr to be integrated with just about any application that can connect to the web.</p>

<p>Reading Tumblr data is easy: just fetch the page at <code>http://(you).tumblr.com/api/read</code> and you&rsquo;ll get a structured XML version of your content in this format:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tumblr version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tumblelog ... &gt;
        ...
        &lt;feeds&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>The most recent 20 posts are included by default. You may pass these optional GET parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>start</code> - The post offset to start from. The default is 0.</li>
<li><code>num</code> - The number of posts to return. The default is 20, and the maximum is 50.</li>
<li><code>type</code> - The type of posts to return. If unspecified or empty, all types of posts are returned. Must be one of <code>text</code>, <code>quote</code>, <code>photo</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>chat</code>, <code>video</code>, or <code>audio</code>.</li>
<li><code>id</code> - A specific post ID to return. Use instead of <code>start</code>, <code>num</code>, or <code>type</code>.</li>
<li><code>filter</code> - Alternate filter to run on the text content. Allowed values:
<ul>
<li><code>text</code> - Plain text only. No HTML.</li>
<li><code>none</code> - No post-processing. Output exactly what the author entered. (Note: Some authors write in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which will not be converted to HTML when this option is used.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>tagged</code> - Return posts with this tag in reverse-chronological order (newest first). Optionally specify <code>chrono=1</code> to sort in chronological order (oldest first).</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed example feeds, see the live Read API on <a href="http://derekg.org/api/read">derekg.org</a> or <a href="http://demo.tumblr.com/api/read">the demo blog</a>. A browser that pretty-prints XML, such as Firefox, is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="json-output">JSON output</h3>
<p>By using <code>/api/read/json</code> instead of <code>/api/read</code> when calling the Read API, the output will be sent as <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> assigned to a Javascript variable named <code>tumblr*api*read</code>. All regular Read API parameters are accepted, plus:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>callback</code> - A function name to call with the JSON object as its only parameter. When set, the function will be called instead of the <code>tumblr*api*read</code> variable being set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://(you).tumblr.com/api/read/json&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    // The variable &quot;tumblr*api*read&quot; is now set.
    document.write(
        '&lt;a href=&quot;' + tumblr*api*read[1][0]['url'] + 
        '&quot;&gt;Most recent Tumblr post&lt;/a&gt;'
    );
&lt;/script&gt;

<h2 id="a-setup-for-posting-to-writeas-blogs-directly-using-siri-shortcuts-the-writeas-cli-and-optionally-drafts-for-mac">A setup for posting to Write.as blogs directly using Siri Shortcuts, the Write.as CLI, and (optionally) Drafts for Mac.</h2>
<p>Though there is currently a <a href="https://code.as/writeas/macos">Write.as desktop application in the works for macOS</a> and the web editor is certainly no slouch, I thought I&rsquo;d attempt to take advantage of my newfound knowledge of <a href="https://github.com/writeas/writeas-cli">the Write.as CLI</a>, <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1u0">Drafts Actions</a>, and <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10981">Siri Shortcuts</a> on macOS to manifest one of my all-time dream integrations: publishing directly to write.as with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248">Drafts</a>.</p>
<p>To start - assuming you already have the CLI installed - lets run <code>writeas help post</code> in our shell:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152664380-32cf084e-bde1-4d59-85d0-9f15c2da78a7.png" alt="WriteasHelpPost"></p>
<p>For my own use, I really needed to consider just two arguments, here: which blog I&rsquo;m posting to and in which format. Since <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Custom%20CSS.css">my blog&rsquo;s CSS</a> overwrites all but <code>monospace</code>, I always publish in <code>--sans</code>. Keeping this in mind, I allotted for these two options in my Siri Shortcut as customizations set on install.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152664543-028221a5-4359-4bdd-8701-15fc38dcb5b2.png" alt="ShortcutSetup"></p>
<p>Now, whenever it&rsquo;s run, my shortcut will be running this command: <code>write-as post -c chaff --font sans</code> plus whatever input I&rsquo;ve given it. By default, it will grab from the clipboard, but I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1u0">a custom Drafts action</a> to send input, instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152664614-b53bc430-caf0-4ecd-9547-df324f6fe836.png" alt="DraftstoWriteasAction"></p>
<p>Very simply, this action simply calls a shortcut entitled &ldquo;Post to Write.as Blog (macOS)&rdquo; sending the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#content-tags">[[safe_title]]</a> of the Draft as the markdown title followed by a space and then the draft&rsquo;s [[body]].</p>

<h2 id="a-drafts-action-group-for-interacting-with-webdav-enabled-sites">A Drafts Action Group for interacting with WebDAV-enabled sites.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks to recent learning, I have managed to manifest one of my alltime fantasy integrations: I have tied Drafts and NeoCities together directly via <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF"><strong>my NeoCities Action Group</strong></a>, which uses <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#webdav">Drafts' native WebDAV support</a> to (technically) interact with any website based on the protocol. I created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375">Koder</a>. It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions - like deleting remote files, for instance - will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate - I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152169590-518d1043-c02b-49a1-9f19-76699362ab96.png" alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup"></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as simple as HTML encoding the [draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to produce <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/A350D578-1CFA-4B5A-8655-74F6B3AD72AE.html">satisfactory results</a>, I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized footer links and <a href="http://bilge.world/colophon">colors</a>.) You can view that template in full <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/8700B562-8716-489A-B554-641549B6B3E5.html">here</a>. To be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action or found among <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/tadpole">Stephen Millard’s TAD library</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153755878-5b40147a-040b-4e8f-83ae-ce187d40ec0d.png" alt="toDraft-UUID"></p>
<p>The most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E.html">the draft I’m currently whittling on</a>, enumerated <code>7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E</code>. The action above - <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ve">Draft to /drafts as UUID.html</a> - will push the contents of your current draft to /drafts/<code>the Draft’s UUID</code>.html. (That&rsquo;s how I created the example.)</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153760436-80095f77-6d9a-4325-8b09-e871bb812bb2.png" alt="NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done my best to color code the actions based on the potential &ldquo;severity&rdquo; of their result, but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=updated">Drafts theme</a> you&rsquo;re using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue/green indicate the &ldquo;safest&rdquo; actions - like the ones that simply <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vc">open a link to a draft you&rsquo;ve already pushed</a> - and yellow/orange/red actions involve <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1v9">pushing/manipulating files at the root of your site</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1uF">the whole bit</a>. You&rsquo;ll need to edit each action and replace <code>davidblue.wtf</code> with your own URL(s) unless you&rsquo;d like to try and attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.</p>

<h2 id="my-new-twitter-jail-siri-shortcut-marks-a-milestone-in-social-foolery">My new Twitter Jail Siri Shortcut marks a milestone in Social Foolery.</h2>
<p>I graduated high school in 2012. Back then, TweetDeck was still a standalone desktop client[^1] that allowed one to post with just the <code>ENTER</code> or <code>return</code> key. I&rsquo;d made it part of the <a href="https://iowa.neocities.org">Drywall Prime Directive</a> to generally keep <a href="https://twitter.com/ihadtopee">@ihadtopee</a> in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TwitterJail">Twitter Jail</a> as much as possible, which meant pounding my way into it ASAP, daily. This was often my very first task upon returning home from school. All memories - much less computing memories - are quite obscured from that era, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I was spending a cumulative 45 minutes every school day punishing the fuck out of my first flat generation w/keypad Apple Keyboard to TweetDeck in Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TWlTTER_JAIL/status/746295481123274752">https://twitter.com/TWlTTER_JAIL/status/746295481123274752</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that automating Tweets wasn&rsquo;t possible in that era - I&rsquo;d been posting WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME across all my social accounts every morning at 0610 since Freshman year via IFTT (now IFTTT) - but doing so at any sustained rate required actual <em>knowledge</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyHYslaQx4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyHYslaQx4</a></p>
<p>Today, even an rube like myself can whip up <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/"><strong>a Siri Shortcut</strong></a> capable of jailing a user account in <em>less than four minutes</em> from nill - what appears to be a statically-set rate limit of 310 Tweets in that time. Mind you, we&rsquo;re talking about entirely <em>on-device</em> processing here, and - in case you weren&rsquo;t aware - the device I&rsquo;m referring to is my fucking cellular phone.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153808840-473464ae-2922-45a9-a27b-46d0b7f3a247.png" alt="TwitterJailTimeline"></p>
<p><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/"><strong>Twitter Jail</strong></a> technically requires three apps - two of which are ridiculously small, 100% Apple cross-platform, and entirely free - and the third represents simply <a href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">the most refined and delightful means</a> anyone has ever interacted with The Bird Site.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171"><strong>Actions</strong></a> - Free across all platforms and just 3.3mb to download!</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834">Tweetbot</a> (You might also try <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420">Aviary</a> if you absolutely cannot bring yourself to pay a subscription fee, ever.)</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-jar/id1453273600">Data Jar</a> (More or less optional.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon installation, you&rsquo;ll be asked 1.) to set the default number of repeats (Tweets) per run. Obviously, I&rsquo;d recommend ~310 to optimize your jailing. 2.) To specify which Tweetbot-authenticated user account you&rsquo;d like to get jailed, and 3.) which &ldquo;key path&rdquo; (jar) you&rsquo;d like to store the URLs of said Tweets in. The third is almost certainly useless and entirely optional (just delete the Data Jar action,) but&hellip; you never know when&hellip; you might need&hellip; those URLs.</p>
<p>Depending on your device (to some extent, I&rsquo;d imagine,) proceeding to run the shortcut shouldn&rsquo;t take long. It randomly generates 91 characters text from a string (which you should also feel empowered to customize/add to,) Tweets them from your specified account, and stores the URLs of those Tweets in the jar you may or may not have specified.</p>
<p>You might expect me to express envy of any youths reading, but I absolutely feel none. All I can do is encourage you to <a href="https://mastodon.social/invite/hca7L5sY">fucking try Mastodon</a> for God&rsquo;s sake and your own.</p>

<h2 id="update-macos-version-published">Update: macOS Version Published</h2>
<p>I’ve created <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11135"><strong>a macOS version of Twitter Jail</strong></a> which also requires <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171">the Actions app</a> but substitutes <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420">Aviary</a> for Tweetbot given the former’s native Siri Shortcuts action does not require the app to open for each Tweet.</p>
<p>[1] It&rsquo;s actually still available from <a href="https://downloads.digitaltrends.com/tweetdeck/windows">various sources</a> - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetdeck-by-twitter/id485812721">including the Mac App Store</a> - but has fallen way, way out of support.</p>

<p>If you still follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">on Twitter</a>, you’ve seen me posting a lot of mockups and links related to Agile Tortoise’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248">Drafts</a>, lately. I know it probably seems like a phase - and I suppose it is, technically - but I’ve actually been using this darned application for the entirety of my adult life. It’s just that I’ve only recently (read: since 2020 or so) returned to Drafts as my primary text living space from Bear for what I’m sure you’ll regard as <a href="https://beta.bear.app/t/the-line-width-slider-any-chance-i-ll-see-it-again/1945/8">silly reasons</a>. In terms of themes for Drafts, I’ve already hit you with <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1km">one based on this very blog</a> and “<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1kY">Windows Iowa</a>” - both of which have faired far better than I would’ve ever expected on <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=popular">the Drafts Directory</a>.</p>

<p>Now, though, I would like to present “<a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT"><strong>Windows Eternal</strong></a>” - a celebratory theme of ye olde Winders™ Aesthetic, based on one of my very favorite themes for Telegram Messenger for iOS.</p>

You’ll note that I made heavy use of <code>#327c7d</code> (that darkish green color) as often as possible along with <code>#bfc0c1</code> (the main gray) and <code>#000DA6</code> (the main bright blue.)</p>

<p>Though they’re still largely relegated to “<a href="https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts">poweruser</a>” considerations in the mainstream consumer technology eye, clipboard managers have massive potential to make our computing lives better, even on iOS. There was one, in particular, which was universally loved and - if I might add, including myself - universally taken for granted, called Copied. Purchase records show I personally bought “Copied Touch” on iOS in October of 2018, but I think that was actually my second purchase of the app. It was once my primary clipboard manager on iOS. In fact, I was using copied long before I had any familiarity with the term “clipboard manager.”</p>
<p>Around April of last year, I noticed that Copied (the most recent version of the app) was not shareable from the App Store. I <a href="https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/YQYdGyL3Uv-lWXAJIoxWsQFM5QAdfkkqI64y44Ni">reached out</a> to Kevin Chang, Copied’s sole developer, regarding this, and the response was quite solemn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,
<strong>Unfortunately, Copied has been removed from the App Store due to a patent infringement claim. I’m not sure if it will be temporary or permanent yet. Please request a refund from the App Store.</strong>
Kevin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through Tweets - some active via Twitter search, others passively received - I managed to find myself the Token Carrier of Bad Tidings regarding Copied’s death, which is, I suppose, a burden I am more than willing to bear.</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts-bots-and-some-other-methodologies-discovered-since-my-big-telegram-post">Shortcuts, bots, and some other methodologies discovered since my Big Telegram Post.</h2>
<p>Since I published “<a href="https://bilge.world/telegram">I Trust Telegram</a>,” the messenging service has been <em>in the news</em>. Their launch of <a href="https://t.me/s/durov/172">Sponsored Messages</a> predated its publication, but I omitted any mention of them because I’d yet to see any meaningful effects on my own use of the service. All I’ll say now: nearly four months of daily use later, <strong>this is still the case</strong>. I’ve published a few Siri Shortcuts and a Drafts action in the interim, though, and thought these a few additional discoveries worth another post.</p>
<h2 id="siri-shortcuts">Siri Shortcuts</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152031447-334443d7-f038-4518-b65c-2e3305597bdd.png" alt="SeekTelegramMessagebyID"></p>
<h3 id="seek-telegram-message-by-idhttpsroutinehubcoshortcut10930"><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10930">Seek Telegram Message by ID</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://hyp.is/miMJ-oOQEeyVkGegS1hLbw/bilge.world/telegram">I noted in the Big Telegram Post</a>, navigating to/referencing specific messages in Telegram is ridiculously easy due to its URL format: <code>https://t.me/[Channel@]/[Chronological Message ID]</code> My Seek Messages by ID shortcut will prompt you to set defaults for both Channel @ and message number upon installation. This could be useful for channel/group administrators who need to reference/update a message containing community rules, but specifying them is entirely optional. Otherwise, the shortcut will prompt you to enter a channel or group’s @ (minus the symbol itself,) followed by the numeric ID of the message you’re looking for. It will then copy the complete URL to the clipboard and open it in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807">Telegram Messenger for iOS</a>. I’ve found it handy when joining a new channnel/group to quickly indulge my curiosity about its first few messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/152036933-ec106c9c-474d-4c5a-ab0e-ad7da6a97f7a.png" alt="URLListtoTelegram"></p>
<h3 id="url-list--telegramhttpsroutinehubcoshortcut10926"><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10926">URL List ⇨ Telegram</a></h3>
<p>Effectively, this shortcut allows you to send links to a set of Safari 15 tabs to a contact of your choice in Telegram. It’s the singular one of the shortcuts shared in this Post that makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ native Siri Shortcuts actions, and is therefore the most finnicky. In the first take of <a href="https://t.me/extratone/9978">my video demo</a>, it timed out trying to send 200+ links to my Saved Messages channel, but was successful in the second (the take I published) in sending just four links. Upon each run, the shortcut will prompt you to select a contact. The selection <em>must</em> be a phone number, ideally in International Format.[^1] It will then parse a list of URLs in your clipboard and send them one at a time via Telegram’s native action without opening the app.</p>

<h3 id="clipboard--telegram-messagehttpsroutinehubcoshortcut10929"><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10929">Clipboard ⇨ Telegram Message</a></h3>
<p>This one makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ URL scheme, which isn’t really documented properly anywhere.</p>
<p><code>tg://msg?text=[Content]&amp;to=[TargetPhone#]</code></p>
<p>Upon installation, the shortcut will prompt you to specify a target phone number in International Format. In the following runs, the shortcut will open Telegram to the conversation with the phone number you’ve specified (use your own phone number to set it to your personal Saved Messages channel) with the contents of your clipboard in the text entry field. You’ll need to hit <code>Enter</code> or tap the Send Message button to actually send the content.</p>

<h3 id="drafts">Drafts</h3>
<p>Users of Agile Tortoise’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471">Drafts for iOS</a> can use my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1u5">Send Draft to Telegram Saved Messages action</a> to do exactly that.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1488573937223094275">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1488573937223094275</a></p>
<p>Like the last Siri Shortcut above, the action utilizes Telegram’s URL scheme to send the contents of your current draft to a Telegram conversation with a phone number of your choosing. (Remember to change the action’s placeholder!)</p>
<p>If you’d like to specify a different conversation, <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E">this action</a> published to the Action Directory by user maique omits the phone number bit of the URL scheme - <code>tg://msg?=[DraftContent]</code>.</p>

<p>If you happen to have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">Tot Pocket</a> on your iOS device already, I’ve found it a particularly ideal place to compose Telegram messages with formatting and hyperlinks considering its similar format limitations. Drafts users can use my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1uL">Append to 7th Tot Dot action</a> to send draft content to the last Dot directly. Some markdown formatting will need to be altered - #-headings aren’t supported by either Tot or Telegram, for instance - but formatting can be directly carried over to Telegram in Rich Text format by selecting all in Tot and copying, as displayed in the screenshots embedded above.</p>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s <a href="https://github.com/OlegWock/raindrop-telegram-bot">Raindrop Telegram Bot</a> is an absolute must for any users of the Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated in the above screenshots) - it is also <em>the</em> quickest method of saving images, videos, and documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I <a href="https://hyp.is/bGmFuoOgEeyp5F9tAvJq-w/bilge.world/telegram">mentioned in the Big Post</a>, Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of any such integration on iOS.</p>

<p>I’ve gone through the standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for <a href="https://t.me/columbiamo">my experimental local Telegram group</a>. The one I think I’ve settled on, though, is by far the <a href="https://missrose.org/guide/getting-started/adding-rose/">best documented</a> and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss Rose comes conservatively-configured of the box in a sense that one will experience better results than its “competitors” in moderating a small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My personal favorite functions are <code>/notes</code> - which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled with <code>/</code>or <code>#</code> - and <code>/export</code>, which exports the entirety of one’s options (including those notes) as a .txt file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.)</p>

<p>I had absolutely no idea that <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes">Reminders</a> existed in Telegram until a few weeks ago. When sending to one’s Saved Messages channel, holding down on the Send Message button will display the option to <code>Set a Reminder</code>. Anything that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including - in my case - .exe files of programs I’d like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other task management/reminders application that offers this ability - paid or otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-review-of-apple-incs-first-venture-as-a-textile-company">A quick review of Apple, Inc’s first venture as a textile company.</h2>
<p>Now that Apple, Incorporated is a textile company, I thought it might be pertinent of me - someone with incredibly filthy hands - to review its first textile product, the Rag. Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. <em>It’s not good for it</em>, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251502745">Oleophobic coating</a> away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.</p>
<p>What’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected"><em>Connected</em></a>[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how <em>sparsely</em> Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question <a href="https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/836622115880828961/947175164800565248">in the <em>MacStories</em> Discord</a> to only a single response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that&rsquo;s only when I really notice the screen being dirty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155851075-a933d702-8fd0-480d-aaae-a4322d2e46a6.jpeg" alt="Rag on Couch"></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I must admit - it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning <em>truly</em> grubby surfaces. As far as I know, it’s not washable - I probably shouldn’t have thrown the packaging away, but I didn’t expect to review it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1497636091905683456">twitter.com/NeoYokel/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I would advise a strong, rotational approach under moderate pressure when using the Rag on your device’s screen. I would not advise you use it on your face or hands. I also would not advise you use it to clean your dog’s paws after a muddy bout. More reasonably, it’s not even all that great for cleaning glasses lenses. (It might just be that mine are particularly dirty.)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHWKa9P9-7k">https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHWKa9P9-7k</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It sounds a bit silly, but $20 is actually a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single microfiber cloth. I’d link you alternatives, but I’m committed to never sharing Amazon links on this here blog. For what it’s worth, the Apple Rag appears to have a strong resistance to liquids (they just fall off,) and a truly unique competency at cleaning glass screens.</p>

<h1 id="editorially">Editorially</h1>
<p>As an independent, youth-oriented publication it is both our privilege and our duty to seek out innovative methods of communication. In written composition, this means all possible avoidance of unnecessary cliche and/or overused terms (for instance: use of the term “struck” in a metaphor - e.g. <em>what</em> <em><strong>struck</strong></em> <em>me</em>) except where they are critically portrayed. It is essential to remember that <strong>the English language is no more than a tool for our use</strong>, and grammar should not be revered as an immalleable, Holy absolute which we must venerate and obey. Rather, it should be irreverently and liberally manipulated to perform as desired. <strong>Grammar should never be an obstacle</strong> or burden ****in our writing or editing, and should always be discarded in favor of innovative and/or contextual verse.</p>
<p>In general, we write, speak, and publish under the assumption of an intelligent, discerning audience, meaning that we are unafraid of traversing obscure, unusual, or extraordinary detail (technical or otherwise,) that we do not patronize beyond the reasonable ability of a modern reader’s search engine, and <em>especially</em> that <strong>we format copy independently of common web standard “readability</strong>.<strong>”</strong> Our vocabulary and syntax are diverse (though we do not sacrifice <em>undue time</em> to unearthing bizarre, senseless synonyms,) fluid, and occasionally difficult, but written as such for the purpose of colorful, substantial delivery in acknowledgement of the vast resources instantly available to the modern reader. In other words: <em>do not tell what can simply and easily be looked up</em>. With search engines as they are, this is a quickly verifiable/quantifiable factor with a given definition, summary, or abstract. If a writer is in conflict regarding the redundancy of a given bit of information, they can painlessly search for it themselves and observe the same results as the reader would within milliseconds to observe what would and would not be immediately evident. Not only is this approach respectful of the readership’s intellect, it is also a comparatively democratic means of regarding information.</p>

<li>Donald Trump’s last name is to be spelled T-U-M-P. (e.g. <em>The 45th President of the United States, Donald</em> <em><strong>Tump</strong></em>.)</li>
<li>The term “struck” is to be avoided if at all possible, especially in metaphoric context (e.g. <em>what</em> <em><strong>struck</strong></em> <em>me</em>.)</li>
<li>Use of the more unnecessary compositional terms from both lower and post-secondary academia should be avoided. (e.g. <em>in conclusion, in summary,</em> and <a href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/cliches/">other cliches</a>.)</li>

<h2 id="imagine-running-shortcuts-from-anywhere-you-can-place-a-link">Imagine running shortcuts from anywhere you can place a link.</h2>
<p>There seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding a shortcut I posted on RoutineHub a few days ago entitled “<a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11143"><strong>Generate Shortcuts Run Links List</strong></a>,” so I thought I’d attempt to overview how I’ve come to use Shortcuts’ URL scheme as my primary method of calling shortcuts across both iOS and macOS.</p>
<p>The basis of the whole shit is <code>shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=</code> and <code>shortcuts://x-callback-url/run-shortcut?name=</code>. Using these along with URL-encoded shortcuts titles (for those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my first Dot in Iconfactory’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">Tot</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155801898-e6c74cee-c26a-458c-a915-c3f969c6f3fd.png" alt="Tot"></p>
<p>With a few exceptions, all the links you see in the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of these, I typed out by hand with <a href="https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb">a TextExpander snippet</a>. Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:</p>

<p>I had a bit of an issue creating the shortcut, itself. Though Shortcuts includes a native <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/url-encode/">URL Encode action</a>, I couldn’t seem to get it to reliably generate URL-encoded shortcuts names, which is why I inserted the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1492174677">Text Case</a> action, instead.</p>

<p><em>Audio is having a moment</em>, says the cacophony about heavy wood transistor radios humming in the private spaces of a populace under a plague’s siege. In the end, it could only have been the scent of such beautiful desperation to finally lure the money in, followed single-file by the American story, as always. The Undisputed OG of Broadcast Media rises like a Tucson from the embers of ad tech’s Great Crusades not to seek revenge, but to comfort the only known complex verbal species amid their Biggest Babel Breakdown yet. All it requires, truthfully, is a decent <em>approximation</em> of a real two+-sided conversation. Well… An <em>infinite list</em> of such approximations, anyway, to leave playing in the background. To just hear two people taking turns speaking and then listening.</p>
<p>Honestly, I had absolutely zero intention of contributing any more to this <em>Digital Audio Renaissance</em> conversation. Though I have been stipulating about <em>The Fateful Day</em> when Apple might finally give in to its perception of competition and implement any sort of paid/premium content differentiation function in its directory of RSS feeds as the certain beginning of The End of the medium we recognize as “Podcasting,” I still didn’t consider the recent news of this day’s scheduled manifestation worthy of another meta-media post. Nay, it wasn’t until I overheard a <em>Windows Weekly</em> host describe podcasting as a “new medium” with apparent sincerity at some point within its <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly/episodes/721"><strong>seven hundred twenty-first</strong> episode</a> that I truly lost my mind.</p>
<p>My third, fourth and fifth eyes all opened wide, and I realized <strong>he and I were definitely <em>not</em> attributing the same thing to that term, anymore</strong>. You probably shouldn’t already be aware that it’s long been produced by This Week in Tech (stylized popularly as <em>TWiT</em>) - which happens to be <em>the</em> oldest podcast-first, for profit media group I can remember - surviving or not. The live, compressed, fucky frame rate image of Leo Laporte sitting alone in a studio-lit room wearing the crown of studio headphones with a mic pointed vaguely at his face is darn near old enough to be considered a <em>childhood memory</em> of mine. I promise to eschew undue idealizing Really Simple Syndication as an open web end in and of itself, but it <em>Really is</em> important in this conversation. {&raquo;Don’t forget to mention just how little the RSS syntax standard has changed in the past twenty years, if it has at all.&laquo;}</p>
<p><code>https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1384610439519158273</code></p>
<p>I am also <em>not</em> bringing up terminology to resist the extreme breadth of audio content which the label Podcast encompasses - this has been an indisputable truth since the very beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-ideal-means-of-on-the-go-participation-in-the-tildeverse">The ideal means of <em>On The Go</em> participation in The Tildeverse.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story - documented in <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">a Medium post</a> by <em>WIRED</em> Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford - until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png" alt="iSH Shell and a-Shell"></p>
<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306"><strong>Blink Shell &amp; Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png" alt="bbj Out"></p>
<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href="https://blink.sh">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href="https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png" alt="Apreche Reply"></p>
<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136">public pages</a> - exclusively through <a href="https://github.com/extratone/jorts">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note <a href="https://tilde.town/~apreche">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png" alt="Blink Settings"></p>
<h2 id="locally">Locally</h2>
<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes">themes</a> - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js">CLRS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js">Man Page</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png" alt="Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage"></p>
<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png" alt="Repository Cleaning"></p>
<p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png" alt="BaityYouTubeThumbnail"></p>
<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png" alt="Blink and Code"></p>
<p>Blink’s own “<a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png" alt="Blink Keyboard Shortcuts"></p>
<h3 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>
<p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>
<p>After a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png" alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"></p>
<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png" alt="Importing Keys in Blink Shell"></p>
<h2 id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>
<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png" alt="Blink Autocomplete"></p>
<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png" alt="Adding Files App Locations in Blink"></p>
<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png" alt="Blink File Providers"></p>
<p>To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:</p>

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>
<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>

</code></pre></div><p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>
<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>
<h4 id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>
<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fset</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format &quot;%M&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>
<p><img src="https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/spacedustchatminimal.png" alt="Spacedust Chat Minimal"></p>

<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>

<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>

<h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>
<p>Blink has a URL scheme - <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>
<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>

<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer.

<h2 id="the-social-networks-incongruities-better-its-experience-if-you-know-how">The social network’s incongruities better its experience, if you know how.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/">livestream</a> on Facebook from NASA’s official page with a panel of experts discussing Europa’s plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around for most of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman">Shane Langman</a>. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can&rsquo;t get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we&rsquo;d have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/STK8JwB.png" alt="Bobby Smith"></p>
<p>Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive is full of sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!” Indeed.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm">streamed on Periscope</a> (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.</p>
<p>Neither are really very good ways to watch live video - Periscope, notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts - but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history - perhaps even more than any other - but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen <em>much</em> more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.</p>
<p>In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/">latest attempts</a> to minimize its platform’s toxicity - an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its <em>cultural</em> blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/xznLHiq.png" alt="Twitter Home"></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">proudly released</a> the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 - leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and - true to form - immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs represent the industry’s readiest effort to “<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768">bridge</a><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768"> the gap between web and mobile apps</a>,” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the best case to make. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">According to Google</a> - supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design - PWAs are <em>offline-first</em>, <em>instant-loading</em>, and <em>immersive</em> - none of which are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an operating system running primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying">HP Elite X3</a> - the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.</p>
<p>3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">announcement</a> are just… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’t present much of a workload, but perhaps <em>removing</em> functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite users.)</p>
<p><em>Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users left?</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FQvW9MC.png" alt="Twitter Poll"></p>
<p>Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/">plain text password blunder</a>, to its constant inability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the">handle abuse</a>, its endlessly tumultuous <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/twitter-is-replacing-its-head-of-product-again.html">management turnovers</a>, and its growing disinterest and disfavor among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16552536/twitter-user-survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump">the public</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13287818/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter">potential investors</a> alike - our cultural relationship with Twitter and its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its tenth year, which is good news for its continued survival. One could certainly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter">argue</a> that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as an outlier in the connected community palette.</p>
<p>For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing and necessary - a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime third-party staples like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/">Twitterific</a> just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and <a href="https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic"><em>What’s in my Dock?</em></a> videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it’s disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user experience has been allowed to continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development.</p>
<p>TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will ever exist. Before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/">Twitter absorbed the tool</a> in 2011, its <a href="https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw">diverse account integration</a> allowed a user to send a single post across Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com">web application</a>, yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: <em>lists.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png" alt="TweetDeck"></p>
<p>This is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve followed about 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends, which I try to read in its entirety, and <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new">a list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians</a> whom I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network’s linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order">beginning of their progression toward algorithmic relevance</a> thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals over <a href="https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104">missed or stale Tweets</a>, I have taken the time to relay my gospel: <em>lists are linear</em>. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbing timelines, I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296">the displeasure</a> and repeated: <em>lists are linear and ad-free</em>!</p>
<p>I realize how irritating it is when one plays the <em>why doesn’t anyone listen to me?!</em> card, so I’ve created a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">Twitter Moment</a> to document the confusing silence I’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find any cases from the past, so I may be misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other social networks in the future.</p>

<p>Today, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter’s “new” live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their<a href=""></a> existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a <em>purple</em> cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by <a href="https://twitter.com/mygunisquick">Matt Daniels</a> and including <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeelgan">Mike Elgan</a> as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and <em>discussing</em> Spaces.</p>
<p>I was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1260074702204293121">my recent observations</a> of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.</p>
<p>For myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/benpopper?s=21">Ben Popper</a> - formerly one of my favorites on <em>The Verge</em>’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting <a href="https://whyp.it/t/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198">his impressively-disciplined turkey calls</a> from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Yet another former <em>Verge</em> staffer, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsheffer">Sam Scheffer</a>, has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I <em>love</em> Twitter” and “I <em>live</em> on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1366804088629919744">twitter.com/neoyokel/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique <em>opportunity</em> to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: <em>what the fuck are you doing and why???</em> It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was <em>we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends</em>. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.</p>

<p>Already, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the <em>Stress Test</em>, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1362822335041048577">even on software <em>I’m fucking paying for</em></a>.) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say <em>never</em> invite me.</p>

<p>Crucially, though, enabling <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1370838780333146118">my tech bro ass</a> to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be <em>thrilling</em> to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">Kayvon Beykpour</a>, is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">Nilay Patel’s <em>Decoder</em> interview</a> should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">the official Twitter Support page on Spaces</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most <em>regular</em> Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable <strong>business</strong>. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.</p>

<p>Early in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing <em>for me</em>, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec">other important Bekypour interview</a> comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s <em>Big Technology Podcast</em>, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope/">first added audio-only broadcasting</a> in September 2018, followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show/">audio-only guest call-ins</a> in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money/account signups/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet <em>appear</em> abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most <a href="https://bit.ly/enduserwhyp">recently relevant</a> example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only <em>real</em> technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source/open web/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software <em>utterly absurd</em>. The fact that I and others on the beat must <em>speculate</em> if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/tEvlLAkm.jpeg" alt="Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM"></p>
<p>A relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">@NeoYokel</a>, over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">@TwitterSpaces</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/dieselgoth">@dieselgoth</a> - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374639645833711616">Tweeted</a>, I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to <em>leave me on read</em>, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly <em>would</em> be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is <em>for what reason, exactly</em>?</p>
<p>The most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage <em>and</em> left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: <strong>I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service</strong> throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects <em>me</em>, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in <em>The Psalms</em>. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “<a href="https://bit.ly/dbrolodex">hear</a>” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as <em>unnecessarily</em> (perhaps even <em>aggravatingly</em>) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, <strong>not</strong> because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.</p>
<p>While we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???::  in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:</p>

<p>In April, <em>The Outline</em> - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/">closed its virtual doors</a>. I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called &ldquo;<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8423/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website">A Good Place</a>,&rdquo; which began with the tag &ldquo;the internet is too much, but this place is just right.&rdquo; In general, it sought the more wholesome, &ldquo;positive&rdquo; bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet <em>mainstream</em> for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3">Twitter bought before its independent launch</a> that&rsquo;s quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1069117482647076865">twitter.com/NeoYokel/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I&rsquo;ve spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn&rsquo;t understand each other whatsoever. I&rsquo;ve streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d&rsquo;Elegance. Periscope is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">embedded more deeply in society</a> than one would think, considering how little it&rsquo;s mentioned in media.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo">youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>In February 2014, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">Kayvon Beykpour</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/joebernstein">Joe Bernstein</a> founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors &ldquo;including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.&rdquo; A year later, Twitter <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3">bought it for some $50-100 million</a> (not even <em>Business Insider</em> knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">Meerkat</a> - the since-extinct <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/">arguably originating</a> service in the space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By building a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter</a>‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37555100">died</a> at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. &ldquo;The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw">surprise emergence of Meerkat</a> as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat">reported Casey Newton for <em>The Verge</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Periscope, by contrast, maintains an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11635382/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji">archive of past broadcasts</a> for a significant period and allows users to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/save-broadcast">save broadcasts locally</a> on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. <a href="https://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/">Dan Frommer in <em>Quartz</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.</p>

<p>In 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I&rsquo;d sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Jquinta">Juanita</a> and <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Nicole3">Nicole</a> were made. <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/OMFGAshers">Ashers</a> bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)</p>

<p>Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter’s going to <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374680479874568194">stick to its word</a> and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1374664072654958594">a Twitter List</a> specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it’s limited to those who have a <em>public</em> Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A">a playlist</a> on <em>Extratone</em>’s YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only <em>very</em> recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>My <a href="https://uikeycommand.com">project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone</a> has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I <em>did</em> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302">explicitly ask you</a> if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don&rsquo;t consider the answer - a very weak &ldquo;no&rdquo; - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post&rsquo;s existence has the potential to do real harm, <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf">contact me</a> and I <em>will</em> straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.</p>
<p>It’s already as good a place as any, editorially, to initiate the goddamned “<em>good vs. evil</em>” discussion because we could very easily find ourselves sincerely addressing the class implications of Text Fucking, otherwise. I want to offer myself, fully, as your test target and/or guinea pig, if you will. If you’re looking for a phone number upon which to set the sights of any of the methodologies shared here (or otherwise, for that matter,) here is mine: <strong>+1 (573) 823-4380</strong>.

<p>I won’t share any of your identifying information anywhere, nor will I respond unless you ask, but I <em>guarantee</em> I <em>will</em> be utterly delighted to receive any volume of Fuckery in any inbox you’re capable of sending it to because I have been so at the half-dozen or so message strings I’ve received over the past few weeks. Even if you somehow manage to find a means of <em>un</em>delighting me, that would be a far better scenario for all involved parties than my catching word you used one of my shortcuts to send <em>Mein Kampf</em> to a prayer request line or some shit. I promise it will always be more fun to shoot for <em>constructive disruption</em> over edgy bullshit, especially in this New Age when nothing is certain and nobody is talking. As much as the person who wrote the Yelp! review, below, would’ve loved to advocate for contribution to the noise for the simple sake of it, he’s fucking dead.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we’re now free to get specific. Here’s my definition from <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Text-Fucking">the “Text Fucking” entry</a> in <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki"><em>The Psalms</em> wiki</a>:</p>

<p>I might also append an esp. in either neutral or constructive applications. Again, a Zalgoed Tweet every once in a while is funny, but mass spamming strangers in peer-to-peer spaces is not. Not funny in any sense. To draw a medium parallel with audio - as I will several times in this guide, you’ll find - genuinely disruptive text manipulation is like choosing to push your pirate radio out on the volunteer-run community station’s frequency instead of the corporate-owned hits channel’s. Any sense you might be doing something worthwhile dramatically vanishes and the possibility of accomplishing something a bit <em>original</em>, even, is nullified in the womb.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Cu9MC89q.png" alt=" gm2"></p>
<p>I won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It <em>is</em> a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable. Regardless of my performance, however, I genuinely believe Text Fucking can be an endeavor that leads to more “positive” outcomes, whoever you may be. As I did, you might find yourself with a greater appreciation of and a desire to learn more about those individuals and organizations working in the Accessible Technology industry, ever toward a more inclusive digital future. It’s my hope that the weaponization of such an otherwise banal part of life might empower you with the simple fact of your capabilities, even if you don’t ever choose to actually implement them in a single instance.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>As detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files. They were ginormous for plaintext.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1495487495622045699">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1495487495622045699</a></p>
<p>My Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in <a href="https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com">the Drywall Era</a>, when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at <a href="http://eeemo.net">eeemo.net</a>. I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/">on my own NeoCities website</a>, as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that <em>will</em> Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html">a single HTML file</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As Drywall’s first and second albums - <a href="https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura"><em>Hamura</em></a> and <a href="https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy"><em>Suburban Anarchy</em></a>, respectively - were studies in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)">audio clipping</a>, I felt strongly at the time that Zalgo Text was the digital text equivalent, though there were others. The latter’s most wildly-entitled track, “Í£Í†Ì„Ì“Ì‡Ì¿Í›ÍÍŽÍÍ¬Ìƒ&amp;ÍÌµÍ‡Ì Ì¥ÌªÌ„ÌÍŒÍ¯Ì“​$​Ì¯Ì»Ì£ÍšÍ’Ì‰ÌÍ‘,” does not actually include any Zalgo text in its title’s final form, <a href="https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/track/-">on Bandcamp</a>[^6], yet I think we can agree it is thoroughly Fucked. <em>Beyond The Rails</em> was my cringey “label” name, directly describing, technically, the matter of clipping audio. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193">iMovie for iPhone</a> first became available, making actual video editing and creation possible on iPhone OS in the iPhone 4 era, I took advantage of a very particular - but extremely powerful - function that was originally allowed creators on YouTube’s iOS app. It’s very hard to describe without being able to show, but it allowed for the rapid addition of tags to any video via an autocomplete-ish feature, up to the full tag limit. The series of Drywall videos that were essentially just vlogs shot from our high school lunch table - entitled <em>Men and Women of The Armed Forces, This is What You are Fighting For</em>[^7] (MAWOTAFTIWYAFF) - were all thoroughly tagged this way.</p>

<p>The most notable event in my personal text history, though, happened on Mastodon - as much does these days, if you weren’t aware. I was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870">posting about Zalgo text’s creation</a> when <strong>its actual creator</strong>, Dave Higgins - with whom I’d unknowingly been mutuals for some time, apparently - <a href="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224">replied</a>:</p>

<p>If there is a living God/Ultimate Sage/Premiere Authority/Professor of Text Fucking, surely it is they, so to have a conversation with them was quite an honor, especially to be able to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102565952197076202">call them father</a>, of sorts. I continue to pursue this discipline in a largely automated way, as we’ll discuss in depth. It’s not an especially practical or beneficial one, no, but it is mine. (And Dave Higgins’, to be fair.)</p>

<p>The core necessity of any good Text Fucker is a robust text editing and/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a>, unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248">Drafts</a> (big surprise) - which astonishingly has <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vM"><strong>its very own native Zalgo action</strong></a> as developer Greg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400">gift to me</a>! - and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447">Bear</a> (no less of a surprise.) In terms of default configuration intensity, the Drafts action hits the sweet spot out of the box.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:</p>

<p>I have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: <a href="https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review"><strong>UniChar</strong></a> and <a href="https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review"><strong>Zalgo Generator</strong></a>. There’s now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527">a macOS version of the latter</a> which is particularly powerful - or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:</p>

<p>Textcraft offers a customizable list of 90 live “transformations” to the text you’re entering. Here’s a directly-quoted list of use cases from [the app’s press kit](<a href="https://071cf2cf-09dc-47f7-a1e6-296ba59e1c3a.filesusr.com/archives/5aca2a_49a996e8434a485098cc73c2e2b4f36e.zip">https://071cf2cf-09dc-47f7-a1e6-296ba59e1c3a.filesusr.com/archives/5aca2a_49a996e8434a485098cc73c2e2b4f36e.zip</a>? dn=Textcraft_PressKit_ShihabMehboob.zip):</p>
<ul>
<li>For a casual tweeter who wants to TyPe LiKe ThIs with minimal effort.</li>
<li>For an influencer needing to add hashtags before all of their words in a massive word cloud sentence before uploading to Instagram.</li>
<li>For the coder/designer needing to strip HTML or encode/decode strings in Base64.</li>
<li>For the blogger wanting fancy text in bubbles, squares, cursive, or stylised differently on their website.</li>
<li>For the website designer who wants to add underscores between all words for use in code, or change the format between cases.</li>
<li>For the journalist who wants to redact or underline some text.</li>
<li>For the cryptographer who wants to convert strings to SHA128 and SHA256.</li>

As I said in <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/textcraft">my App Store review</a>, the iOS app weighs in at a featherweight 3.7 MB and a reasonable $4.99 one-time purchase fee, which is high value for someone like me.</p>

<h3 id="textexpander">TextExpander</h3>
<p>Another cross-platform application - this one <a href="https://textexpander.com/download">extending to Windows</a>, too - TextExpander has very recently (and quite swiftly) become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with “thousands of people,” supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “<a href="https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started">snippets</a>” as part of “<a href="https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started-for-admin">snippet groups</a>.” In fact, I’ve created <a href="https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b"><strong>a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide</strong></a>. You can view all my TextExpander snippets in <a href="https://github.com/extratone/TextExpander">this GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png" alt=" TextFuckSnippetGroup"></p>
<p>It’s not much just yet, but if you “<a href="https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b">subscribe</a>” to my dedicated Text Fuck snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time.[ ^5] The great pro of TextExpander is its target pro usergroup, for which it is built to be reliable and very powerful. It enables quick macros for strings as short as ⁌•-¬䷂☃︎𝄫𝄢⟫L𝔒’⌤⌄∔×−฿🄕𝄢 up to <a href="https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6">entire book chapters</a>. It also has more complex functions, likely the most relevant to our use of which being clipboard insertion anywhere within a snippet. Crucial to the strong Text Fucker, this function has high potential for multiplied volume. One might set up a snippet that duplicates the clipboard’s content nine times on new lines and attach the macro <code>\9</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154876382-95749054-1a47-4dec-9e4d-0c2e1229f79e.png" alt=" COMIN DINE"></p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>Debatably, my personal history with automation began with the release of IFTT (now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt-automation-workflow/id660944635">IFTTT</a>) somewhere around 2010-2011. Once it was integrated with Twitter and Evernote, I set it to save all of my Twitter favorites in separate, tagged Evernotes. The result was quite tremendous, as you might imagine, and is partially immortalized in my current <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/twitter-13759854">Twitter Raindrop collection</a>. Tremendous, but not in a Text Fucking sense. Sometime just after high school, though, I configured an IFTT recipe that posted “WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME” across my social networks, every morning at 6:10 AM.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492783081593483266">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492783081593483266</a></p>
<p>It was in the same era that one of my handful of lifetime genius ideas came to me: it occurred to me that I could automate <a href="https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com">the Drywall Tumblr page</a> entirely by signing up its “post via email” address for all the spam lists I could find. The result is axiomatic. It is also Text Fucking, emphatically. Though I certainly didn’t know it by the name “automation,” then - nor did I associate the term with anything digital, really - contemporary personal automation enables virtually infinite Text Fucking possibilities. No longer does one have to manually copy the entirety of a huge Wikipedia page in order to break their friend’s phone for 5 days - now, they need only configure a native app on their cellular telephone to send <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10919">the whole of the <em>Spy Kids 3</em> screenplay</a>, for instance, to said friend, in the background, even, as they continue scrolling through the Ticking App.</p>
<p>Of course, while the means of <em>distributing</em> Text Fuckery have gotten vastly more robust, capable, and sophisticated, so too have the terminals by which intended targets <em>experience</em> the Fuckery. The friend’s handset and elemental carrier plan in our example may very well be perfectly capable of receiving an entire film script, line-by-line, also in the background, perhaps even without the target ever noticing or suffering a single consequence.</p>
<h3 id="siri-shortcuts">Siri Shortcuts</h3>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png" alt=" TextFuckShortcuts"></p>
<p>A standalone method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is achieved through its relatively “new”[^2] personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts. In fact, Apple includes what I would define as a genuine Text Fucker™ of a shortcut in its default shortcuts gallery, called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51392bf23f104b93baf72000955ed334">All the Single Ladies ASCII</a>” which can be used to create rather adorable text snippets like this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Through a Reddit thread I’ve never been able to find again, I discovered a method of randomizing strings of text that led to the creation of the Shortcuts you see at the bottom of this section, all with native actions (aside from the outputs of those with specific services.) If you’re willing to splurge on the whole 3.3mb, free (for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171"><strong>Actions app</strong></a>, you can accomplish the same task, but much more quickly and with less resource consumption. I think you can spare the space.[ ^3]</p>
<p>Perhaps the best place to start would be with the most documented (and perhaps most unique) Text Fucking Siri Shortcut I have to offer you. “<a href="https://bilge.world/twitter-jail">The Fastest Route to Twitter Jail</a>” in fact details the workings of <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/"><strong>my Twitter Jail shortcut</strong></a>, which uses <a href="http://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">Tweetbot</a>’s shortcuts actions to send 310 Tweets of random text in less than four minutes to an account of your specification.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153768899-51ed409f-7fef-46d0-978f-8a5fc19ad5f7.png" alt=" Random Text ⇨ Clipboard"></p>
<p>If you’re new to Shorcuts entirely, what you see above will result in a string of random text copied to your clipboard, so that you can paste it whereever you might “need” to. Notably, I’ve been extremely lazy with the strings, despite having <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unichar-unicode-keyboard/id880811847">the absolute best app for creating them</a> on my iPhone. I’d suggest you download it and play around yourself. As I said in <a href="http://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review">my review</a>, UniChar is a beautiful celebration of the diversity of Unicode. If what I’m talking about isn’t straightforward-sounding to you, <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf">let me know</a>! I absolutely <em>will</em> sit down and build something just for you.</p>

<h3 id="text-case">Text Case</h3>
<p>Christopher R Hannah’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1492174677">Text Case</a> is by far the most modern of all the dedicated text manipulation applications I have to share with you. Available (separately) on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859">macOS</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596">iOS</a>, it’s a “flow”-based, Siri Shortcuts-resembling text formatting app with some very powerful functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154810776-5ecc4fb5-2fd3-48e3-be1b-d86287cd1965.png" alt="TextCase"></p>
<p>I know that’s basically word-for-word what anyone else’s had to say about it since its debut, four years ago&hellip; I apologize for the redundancy, but the way it works is extremely hard to describe in a way that makes any sense, especially just with a few video clips and/or static images.[ ^4]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png" alt="MLADraft Shortcut"></p>
<p>Without being able to share my own “flows” (unfortunately,) all I can share with you is <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6fd60faf566142b3b7d1fb0a0631fa1b">this Siri Shortcut</a> which is called from <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wQ">this Drafts action</a> to reformat selected text (or the entire contents of the current draft) into proper MLA Title format before amending the results to a specific draft. I also created and published a shortcut called “<a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11094">Speak Word Count</a>” which uses Text Case’s Word Count “format” and <a href="https://bilge.world/siri-tts">Siri Speech Synthesis</a> to speak aloud the word count of either the current selection (from the share sheet) or the contents currently in the system clipboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png" alt=" Fuck Shortcut"></p>
<p>I’ve also created <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/edcc737ed7304a17bb3b4d8897aae29c"><strong>Fuck</strong></a> - a Siri Shortcut with three of my favorite Text Case formattings so far in succession: “Mocking Spongebob” (ick,) “Upside Down,” and “Clap Case.” It acts upon - and replaces - any text you’ve copied to the clipboard. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ᴉ┴ 👏 ∀ɔʇs 👏 nԀou 👏  👏  👏 ∀up 👏 ɹƎd˥ɐɔǝs 👏  👏  👏 ∀u⅄ 👏 ┴Ǝx┴ 👏 ⅄On’Λǝ 👏 ɔoԀIǝp 👏 ┴o 👏 ʇɥǝ 👏 ɔlᴉdqo∀ɹp

<h3 id="drafts">Drafts</h3>
<p>Though I already mentioned Drafts’ Zalgo action earlier, the app worth its own heading, here, because it’s what enabled me to generate the text images embedded in this Post with a single keyboard shortcut. The magic is not in fact happening within Drafts, but rather in the Siri Shortcuts it calls and provides text for. These two are customized for me (so you’ll need to delete the actions you don’t want/need,) but will faithfully reproduce the style of the images you’ve seen as configured for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977">Toolbox Pro</a> users.</p>

There are a few actions from other creators I have yet to mention. Tim Nahumck’s <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Bg">Text Modifier</a> action - as pictured in the screenshot embedded below - is a handy one, as is Greg’s own <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1T2">Unicode Fun</a>.

There’s quite a myriad of available “weird text” tools available on the open web, found easily with the most basic bitch search engine queries. <a href="http://megacooltext.com">MegaCoolTest.com</a> is an old favorite of mine[^8] that functions a lot like Textcraft, come to think of it.</p>
<p>I originally intended to thoroughly test some of the results found when searching the App Store for “<a href="itms-apps://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?media=software&amp;term=weird%20text">weird text</a>,” but they’re far too numerous and - for the most part - far too janky to be worthwhile.</p>

<p>Earlier this afternoon, I put out <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492591057950892040">an ask on Twitter</a> regarding how to use JavaScript to create a native Drafts Action for Zalgo Text. Delightfully, tagging @draftsapp in that post paid off, for just a bit ago, Greg - Drafts’ sole creator and guardian - <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400"><em>actually replied</em></a> with a link to <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1vM"><strong>an action he’d just posted</strong></a> called “Zalgos.”</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Indeed, <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974">it is here</a></strong>. Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the <a href="https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps">third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase</a> just before this item in <em>The Psalms</em>’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/">Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development</a> on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries [Mastodon’s] name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app <em>Specialized</em> in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a <a href="https://patreon.com/mastodon">Patreon</a> supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E">https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E</a></p>
<h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>
<p>I’d like to offer the <a href="https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E">demo video</a> embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it <strong>the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available</strong>. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png" alt="Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<p>First, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like <a href="https://instances.social">instances.social</a> - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably <strong>easy-to-understand</strong> and <strong>not open to interpretation</strong>, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.</p>
<p>After we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus">inexplicable errors</a> exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system&rsquo;s intra-app linking function (with the syntax <code>mastodon://</code>,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed <em>within the Mastodon app</em> instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.</p>
<p>After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by &ldquo;a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language,&rdquo; as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440">Eugen explained</a> in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That&rsquo;s the whole bit! If you need &ldquo;proof,&rdquo; <a href="https://mastodon.online/@keys">here is the finished result</a>, but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It&rsquo;s a cliché, yes, but seriously&hellip; What do you have to lose?)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png" alt="Trending & Profile Editing in Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p>One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one&rsquo;s profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social&rsquo;s equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by <em>actually using these features</em>. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png" alt="Polling in Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3>
<p>As of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled &ldquo;Post on Mastodon.&rdquo; Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<strong><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/">Mastodon Share</a></strong>&rdquo; - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<strong><a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/">Mastgur</a></strong>&rdquo; - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action&rsquo;s lack of multimedia support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/H212I22P.png" alt="Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<p>Mastodon friend Emma&rsquo;s <a href="https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709">customization of the latter</a> is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>As of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches">a single news item from </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches">The Verge</a></em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches">’s Adi Robinson</a>, which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s <a href="https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone">blatantly inconsistent enforcement</a> of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who <em>does</em> occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which <em>do</em> support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found ~70-80% of <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv">the 600+ accounts I follow</a>, there. (Though it should be noted that I <em>do not</em> represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)</p>
<p>Though the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the <em>initial release</em> version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png" alt="Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<p>Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223">no multiple account support</a>?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring <a href="https://github.com/extratone/mastodon-ios-apps">the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS</a> (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel <em>pretty well covered</em> when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by <em>more than a dozen alternatives</em> is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200">Amaroq</a>, and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.</p>
<h2 id="delights">Delights</h2>
<p>The “relentless originality” I spoke of in my <em>third-party</em> showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png" alt="Mastodon for iOS Audio Player"></p>
<p>Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.</p>
<p>Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of <strong>Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts</strong> provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘<em><a href="https://github.com/extrakeys">iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard</a></em> project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)</p>

<td style="text-align:center">An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that <strong>this app could have been very bad</strong>. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it <em>should</em> have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user <em>not</em> finding it refreshing in some way.</td>

</table>
<p>I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, <em>but</em> they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has <em>never</em> crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app.</p>

<p>As I touched on in <a href="https://bilge.world/2021">my 2021 overview of <em>The Psalms</em></a>, this blog has undergone some very significant - and mostly involuntary - changes of late. This summer has abruptly brought some life happens which will inevitably contribute further changes to a degree that warrants a very bloggy sort of Update Post.</p>
<p>Most importantly, perhaps, is that I&rsquo;ve found myself with a real, tangible, full-time Big Boy job as a nighttime custodian of <em>my actual elementary school</em>. Though I suppose it&rsquo;s never been revealed before, here, I actually love cleaning and love this school, particularly, so I&rsquo;m more excited than I&rsquo;ve ever been for any sort of documentable employment, but this means I will imminently be transitioning from a lifestyle with virtually zero time-bound obligations to working 3-11:15PM, Monday through Friday. Undoubtedly, this will have a profound effect on my <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1542999255497023489">recently-announced</a> <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/services">consultancy business</a>, but I&rsquo;ll be making an effort to formally update the adjacent Fantastical Openings links with revised availability.</p>

<p>Adjacent to this news are the experiences I&rsquo;ve had in the past few weeks helping a friend ready her third-grade, public school classroom, which have been particularly enlightening with regard to the extent that iPads have been integrated into the education of young children in this country. Some highlights from this discovery (in this particular, Title I Midwestern elementary school):</p>
<ul>
<li>Every child will receive a 5th-generation, WiFi-only iPad (<a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/specs/apple-ipad-9-7-inch-early-2017-wi-fi-only-specs.html">iPad6,11</a>) which they will be able to take home over the course of the school year.</li>
<li>The district paid $299 per unit for said iPads, a mere $30 off their full retail price for the rest of us, $329.</li>
<li>The random device I picked up from the pile shown in the images embedded above had not been updated beyond iPadOS 15 (since March of this year.)</li>
<li>Responsibility for the maintenance, setup, and deployment of said iPads rests entirely on a single individual, who is also responsible for the &ldquo;media center&rdquo; (what many of us know as the <em>Library</em>.)</li>
<li>Responsibility for ongoing hardware considerations (charging and storage) is left entirely to individual teachers.</li>
<li>Net contributions from Apple, Inc. to this new aspect of childhood education reside some six or seven figures <em>in the negative</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the two weeks preceding our district&rsquo;s start date, I had the painful opportunity to tour some of my friend&rsquo;s colleagues' storage solutions for their student iPads. The image below is the one I chose to append to my appeal to the <em>MacStories</em> Discord, attempting to <em>leverage</em> workspace-obsessed yuppies' knowledge for the benefit of public education.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1o0iA322.png" alt="Sad iPad Rack"></p>
<p>There were a few helpful replies, which made it clear that organizations with actual budgets for device storage have gravitated toward rolling carts.</p>

<p>Assuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the truth in what I’m about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally - big fuckin whoop. I think it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce">wholly reconfigured into a consumerist holiday</a> long ago) to speculate on how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a <em>stubbed toe whilst walking on water</em> incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the <a href="https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil">openly-blasphemous</a> one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I’m afraid he’d be too much of an <em>End User</em> idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc">the laptop we’ve always wanted them to make</a>,” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air you just bought?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “<a href="https://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>,”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an essay designed primarily to express that <em>Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of the people</em> without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to <a href="http://bilge.world/federated/">social networks</a>, yet - as two thousand eighteen comes to an end - I’ve managed to find myself among the most <a href="https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs">jaded, soul-sapped</a> tech community I have yet encountered: <strong>Microsoft Administrators</strong>.</p>
<p>Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’s hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft&rsquo;s most laptopy Surface laptop - which exists in large part to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2">compete directly with</a> Apple&rsquo;s beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air - wouldn&rsquo;t be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: <em>for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible</em>. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man - this <a href="https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review">wasn&rsquo;t even the first time</a> I&rsquo;d been surprised with the &ldquo;hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today&rdquo; experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to my <em>Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism</em>, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10">Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop 2</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the vast majority of its users are <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television">trapped inside my television</a>, there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’ll indulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us <strong>The Laptop II</strong> - as in, the sequel&hellip; the <em>successor</em> to <em>every other laptop computer</em> yet conceived&hellip; but does this one machine truly represent the second coming of the <em>Notebook Christ</em>? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly <em>are</em> certain elements of this Personal Computing product&rsquo;s execution which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in coming years. As I&rsquo;ve stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft&rsquo;s. (Note: no other technology company has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)</p>
<p>I must be honest: it hasn&rsquo;t yet been two months and I&rsquo;ve already scuffed and perhaps even <em>stained</em> the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I might draw upon the vast library of <a href="https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs">automotive interior tutorials</a> available on YouTube - and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend - in order to <em>really</em> maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/">alcantara was undeniably car culture’s material first</a>. I should also confess that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for <em>my personal uses</em> that I’ve ever owned <em>or</em> used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make it so - like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I/O complement - have yet had the chance to seduce my emotional brain into truly <em>loving</em> it as much as I certainly should by any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still ask that you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a <em>package</em> with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s “<a href="https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/">best laptop</a>” were Apple’s aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone&rsquo;s needs are going to be different, which is why there&rsquo;s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am <em>anything</em> but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825"><strong>four hours and twenty-two minutes</strong></a> of a workload it wasn’t particularly designed for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert - Vox Media’s “<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast">only Windows user</a>” - reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’t know what any of y’all are doin - I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends - further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was <em>actually designed to be nice to use</em>. For the sake of those readers <strong>actually in the market for a new laptop</strong> who’ve somehow found themselves here, though, Raymond Wong’s review for <em>Mashable</em> is the most thorough offering you’ll find - it’s quoted front and center on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B">Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II</a>, even - but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its ultimate competitor, <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air/">the new MacBook Air</a>. Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that <em>Mashable</em> as a publication stands by my new laptop’s <em>Best of the Year</em> title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT">MacBook Air</a> came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there&rsquo;s nothing that innovative about it. In today&rsquo;s Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your first point of comparative entry should be <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast">a barely-dated conversation</a> between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on <em>Too Embarrassed to Ask</em> regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer to hear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/">the original product direction of the Surface line</a> still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review">contributed so much</a>. Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of <em>Extratone</em>) with great respect and deep fondness - I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth - the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with <em>far</em> superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835">Joshua Topolsky’s projections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft</a> from history’s freshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft&rsquo;s teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That&rsquo;s a big shift, and it&rsquo;s an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for <em>all</em> parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the <em>whole three months</em> that passed before <a href="http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html">his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012</a>. Ultimately, The Big M is either <strong>incapable</strong> of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own, or simply <strong>overwrought</strong> with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally <em>tell the fucking story</em>, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrast with “<em>people</em> would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) - as if Steve-O himself doesn’t even have the power to publicly <em>describe his company’s function</em> as its #1 man - combined at the apex of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you&rsquo;ll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powers these cloud services, but it&rsquo;s a different form of delivery&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these three sentences - there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have provided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst to restore <em>any</em> sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall 2017, <em>The Register</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/">quoted industry gossip</a> regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future">sustaining future of the line</a>, though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examine what the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per <em>The Present &amp; Future of Computing</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-clam-clan">The Clam Clan</h2>
<p>In case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years - if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships with consumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets were capable of doing so.</p>
<p>Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work - it’s booted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks - from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs - which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming <a href="http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/">the first and only iPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support</a> in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review">convertibles</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black">removable keyboards</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features">‘professional’ tablets</a>. I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html">System76 Galago Pro</a> could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility - that the reputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a real shame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to <strong>give them to the world</strong>.</p>
<p>The opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479">the value of keyboard shortcuts</a>, gave me <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537">my first real proficiency with a command line</a>, helped <a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Revelations-of-Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq/a-a235vs3">globalize my comprehension of my own technological privilege</a>, reacquainted me in a huge way with both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/">the true history of software</a> and my own personal past as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256">an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s</a>, and helped to answer a lot of questions I’d worried over for years about why software seemed like it simply <em>couldn’t improve</em> anymore. While it’s true that important open source projects like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289">ElementaryOS</a> continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">growing Open Source community on Mastodon</a> is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with so far are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the <em>Ask Noah Show</em>. (It’s not as if I haven’t said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something <em>father</em> on a semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)</p>
<p>Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that <strong>Linux is still let down most by its own community</strong>, but the operating system itself is still <em>much</em> further along on its way to becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to <em>really</em> learn about Open Source computing <em>also</em> helped me understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did <em>actually writing</em> - I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically creating <em>a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu</em>. Though I swore I’d never succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of the operating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that <em>I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all</em>. The most profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: <strong>for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be productive</strong> because <em>apparently</em>, I don’t have the self-control to keep myself from <em>running away</em> and/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between “computer people” and everyone else who simply <em>uses</em> computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own “<a href="https://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history">Word Processing Methodology</a>” essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’ve continued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for <a href="https://bear.app/#pricing">Bear Pro</a>, I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified. <strong>Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen</strong>, but I’m now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. It turns out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app">Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter</a> <em>really was</em> worth more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.”</p>
<p>Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud <em>really does</em> make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply <em>get shit done</em>. It’s clear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and/or educational distributions, but let me just add that <strong>the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game</strong> without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises - all without detracting from any other technically-minded distributions whatsoever. <em>That</em> is the magic of <em>The Distro</em>, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products - despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself - <em>you’re very welcome</em> for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their arguments have magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and <a href="https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review">even its much-younger iOS counterpart</a> - as well as the billions of people who depend on them - <em>desperately</em> need real competition in order to maintain their viability, much less become what products of the world’s wealthiest company <em>should</em> be.</p>
<p>Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really <em>is</em> an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for another <em>paradigm shift</em> in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard">Apple’s release of this year’s new iPad Pro</a> prompted even <a href="https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13">the most Cupertino-loving</a> tech commentators to respond with <em>genuine discord</em> along with a few long-overdue shouts of “<em>are you crazy</em>?!” I’m very proud of <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="http://twitter.com/reckless">Nilay Patel</a>, in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features">his full review of the updated product</a>, along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement.</p>
<p>I’ve favored <em>The Verge</em> and its cast long past the point of excess throughout the span of my work about technology, but Nilay’s review and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review">accompanying episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a> are <em>truly</em> special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently - as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins - his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s own favorite child of late - into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly <em>sponsoring</em> over its much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing - has unequivocally <strong>failed</strong> to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’s performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, the world’s first trillion-dollar company’s <em>other</em> major product release of 2018 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/">managed to disappoint</a> even the most fanatical fans of its original operating system’s best-selling platform with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price">an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air</a> marque upon which it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/">once so fondly doted</a>.</p>
<p>My best friend’s parents bought her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review">the original Surface tablet</a> when she enrolled in art school, and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and Microsoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the <em>most</em> current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in, but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, <em>I</em> for one have been completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for my use, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.</p>

<h2 id="a-safari-through-the-enchanting-space-of-third-party-mastodon-clients-on-ios">A safari through the enchanting space of third-party Mastodon clients on iOS.</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and went as I wrote this guide - you can metaphorically picture me looking up from my machine having overheard the news of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">2021 Apple Design Award Winners</a> announcement. Perusing through them, I saw two I would have voted for, myself: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574">CARROT Weather</a> - the <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1368223231111557125">beautifully vulgar</a>, grumpy bitch frontend for your preferred weather information service, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127">Craft</a> - perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two or three years - listed under &ldquo;Finalists.&rdquo; (Read: losers.) The most positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/"><strong>Be My Eyes</strong></a>, which &ldquo;connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers and company representatives for visual assistance through a live video call,&rdquo; along with an exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader/id496177674">Voice Dream Reader</a>. <em>However</em>, a double take in games from <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990">the fucking <em>League of Legends</em> game</a> certainly sours the mouth and suggests yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has <em>sold out</em>.</p>
<p>The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth&rsquo;s sake over any and all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but there <em>is</em> an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted software. The necessity of this guide - and the bizarrely silent ignorance of even the &ldquo;fringes&rdquo; on its subject - is unimaginably severe. Before me has been (for years, now,) the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; to a Jolly Big Load of what tech and marketing types lament in more and more existential language, yet <em>hardly any</em> of the humans with the most to lose from  their negligence - regular, casual social media users - have been delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated. <strong>The journalism is not being done.</strong></p>
<p>I know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one motherfucker&rsquo;s complaints about WWDC, but - as with everything Apple, Inc. does - every morsel of curatorial expression/discrimination/favoritism from The Great Money God within this platform <em>must</em> be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I found myself completely at a loss as to how <em>not</em> to dwell on the Discovery Disparity, here.</p>
<p>Despite how deeply I&rsquo;ve gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I&rsquo;ve ever seen remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.&rsquo;s mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I&rsquo;ve invested into App Guides - a space to which I never would have imagined intentionally bringing <em>The Psalms</em> - I hope you can understand.</p>

<p>I must confess: I have been <em>meaning</em> to write this app guide since even before I <a href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview">interviewed Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko</a> on the morning of his Big Press Day, just over 4 years ago. I’ve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself, published an <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/">official blog post</a> at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform.” As a Patreon supporter of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">The Mastodon Project</a> (full disclosure,) I&rsquo;ve been testing this app (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature applications in their own right. (Also, it’s become quite apparent that the normal tech media sources you’d go to for such a guide aren’t going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Y624NGHM.jpg" alt="Masto Mascot iOS Art"></p>
<h2 id="obligatory-context">Obligatory(?) Context</h2>
<p>I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who&rsquo;s function is to prompt academic conversations about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social&rsquo;s solutions to all of the Big Web&rsquo;s Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though I have been compelled to <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bigblue">invest significantly</a> in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that <strong>Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social space</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know, this seems to have become <em>my general shit</em>, for lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open source/&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; software are very important, yes! &hellip; but they are <em>far</em> from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The second of <a href="https://bilge.world/about">this World Wide Web Blog&rsquo;s fundamental considerations</a>, in fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their <em>brand image</em> (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. <strong>Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blog on which you&rsquo;re reading this, in fact, is federated on <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. If you so chose, you could be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The crucial point, though, is that <em>you didn&rsquo;t need to know that</em> - you could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy regarding Federation.</p>
<p><em>Oh boy, here we go&hellip;</em> No. I did not want to say anything ideological - I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit posts I&rsquo;ve seen to the tune of &ldquo;is there an iPhone app?&rdquo; As I explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless - sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been <em>so</em> much easier than I thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you&rsquo;ve actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you&rsquo;re undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called &ldquo;feature overlap&rdquo;  at one time has become all but the platform&rsquo;s core ethos. If you&rsquo;re the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318">twitter.com/NeoYokel/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is currently oversaturated nigh <em>beyond usability</em> with mediocre entries built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function. This, alone, wouldn&rsquo;t be so problematic if Discovery were not so <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1379068906917224448">completely and totally Fucked</a> (except when <a href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/">dev-facing</a>,) but I needn&rsquo;t comment further on that subject at the moment - I&rsquo;m just trying emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single protocol/service&rsquo;s third-party client representation on iOS to be so thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of these apps <em>in a functional state</em>, actually. In all my equivalent experiences downloading the entirety of a given service&rsquo;s API-supported palette (e.g. IRC apps, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover">topically</a>,) an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that <em>actually work</em> at the given moment. (I&rsquo;d have mentioned the &ldquo;best [service/task] iPhone apps for [year]&rdquo; listicles found in online publications like <em>Digital Trends</em> were it not for the percentage of them in which it&rsquo;s clear the author <em>did not actually download</em> some/most of the apps listed‽‽‽) Perhaps due to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97">iOS 14.5&rsquo;s implementation of ATT</a>, all of the Mastodon apps I could find and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness' interest) are currently functioning.</p>
<p>So, if there&rsquo;s virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download one of the apps we&rsquo;re about to consider and find it broken, what practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery intriguing, hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-6">The Big 6</h2>
<p>My first step in writing this guide was to post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/mxymr1/your_thoughts_on_thirdparty_mastodon_clients_for/">a thread on r/Mastodon</a> soliciting thoughts on third-party Mastodon apps from other users, who expressed a lot of love for Toot! and Metatext:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games&hellip;which really aren&rsquo;t needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mikepictor/">u/mikepictor</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pragmatic Code&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426">Linky</a> was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It&rsquo;s not a client, but a bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it is an obligatory mention. So too is the <a href="https://github.com/extratone/mastodon-ios-apps"><strong>GitHub Repository/List</strong></a> I created in order to &ldquo;formally&rdquo; offer a list with much greater brevity and zero editorialization.</p>
<p>First, let’s begin with The Big 6 - those apps The Mastodon Project, itself, has seen fit to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">list on joinmastodon.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=LdBFMibyh3Y">youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<h3 id="toothttpsappsapplecomapptootid1229021451"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a></h3>
<p>Dag Ågren‘s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a> is not only my personal app of choice - I would (and have) go so far as to say it’s the single most innovative mobile social app I’ve ever encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection. It’s held a place in my phone’s dock since the day I first downloaded it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J">its wholly unique Share Sheet interface</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png" alt="Toot! Themes"></p>
<p>Toot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am quite superficial in my taste. It’s Obsidian theme (which may or may not be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is especially gorgeous.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106302686196643266">cacophonous attempt</a> to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps simultaneously, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Toot!&rsquo;s always came first. Its <a href="https://whyp.it/t/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997">charming custom audio alerts</a> also make them my favorite by far.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered function of these apps - serving as representing the network as a whole - it occurred to me that <strong>Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone have prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild than I can count</strong>. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding mechanism.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/30YJR456.png" alt="Toot! Settings"></p>
<p>In my experience, it’s also the most robust of the lot - as in, it is very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/KF4Slx39.png" alt="Mast for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="masthttpsappsapplecomusappmast-for-mastodonid1437429129"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129">Mast</a></h3>
<p>I originally had high hopes for Shihab Mehboob‘s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129">Mast</a> - which used to look very different from the way it does, today. That’s almost certainly to do with its ownership <a href="https://twitter.com/jpeguin/status/1354854403124178947">changing hands</a> at some point (no, I do not have any further details on that story, unfortunately.) That’s not to say the current app isn’t a worthwhile offering, it’s just far less <em>visually ambitious</em> than the original I remember. However, it’s also significantly more reliable.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JPEGuin/status/1354854403124178947">twitter.com/JPEGuin/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/UsH95qJv.png" alt="Mast Details"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/JV5vzmky.png" alt="Amaroq for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="amaroqhttpsappsapplecomusappamarok-for-mastodonid1214116200"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amarok-for-mastodon/id1214116200">Amaroq</a></h3>
<p>The Original… Genesis… If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon app on the App Store, it’s certainly the oldest to survive. Its GitHub Repository’s <a href="https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86">first commit</a> dates back to April 17th, 2017.  While you’re there, you might note that it’s the only one of these entries coded entirely in Objective-C - the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS before Swift’s birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It’s been nearly a year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it <em>does</em> include are rock solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7A9pJMzD.png" alt="iMast for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="imasthttpsappsapplecomusappimastid1229461703"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imast/id1229461703">iMast</a></h3>
<p>For better or worse, <a href="https://mstdn.rinsuki.net/@rinsuki">@rinsuki</a>’s iMast will require either a basic grasp of the Japanese language, or the patience to translate its menus and work backwards. (OCR came to mind, but I’m not quite dedicated enough to try it for this guide.) Assuming <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:64ce057e-5adc-4578-a0ef-e9ddb6b5d545">Google’s translation</a> of <a href="https://cinderella-project.github.io/iMast/">its GitHub Pages site</a> is correct, iMast is also Open Source “under the Apache License 2.” Unlike Amaroq, it appears to have been built in Swift from the ground up. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s about all I can comment on, though I would very much love to hear from any iMast users/Japanese speakers and will update this Post accordingly.</p>

<p>Daniel Nitsikopoulos' <a href="https://onmercury.app">Mercury</a> represents yet another entirely original direction in Social clients. It&rsquo;s fresh and &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; in its explicit lack of support for instances that &ldquo;<a href="https://onmercury.app/help">promote abuse and harassment</a>.&rdquo; From all appearances, this appears to be the singular source of negative reviews on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mercury-for-mastodon/id1486749200">its iOS App Store page</a>. It&rsquo;s also the other option to offer widgets integration (in a single form, currently,) and custom audio notifications, though I couldn&rsquo;t capture a sample. Its <a href="https://trello.com/b/6EseiLSQ/mercury-roadmap">Trello Roadmap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dNitza/mercury-issues/issues">Feedback Repo</a> are public but mostly inactive. As you can see in the grid embedded above, I absolutely adore its Scoops theme and find my $0.99 Tip 100% worth its custom icons.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unfortunately, the state of Mercury&rsquo;s App Store reviews prompt yet another essential economic/editorial consideration. The one in the very center of the image embedded, above - from &ldquo;FeralDandelion&rdquo; - is the singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is <strong>exhaustively explicit about this from very get-go</strong>. Its <a href="https://onmercury.app/help">single-page Help document</a> includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every single blocked instance and <em>the specific justification</em> for each respective instance&rsquo;s presence on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as such does not support many instances that promote abuse and harassment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is <strong>exclusively positive</strong>. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort of fixation on ideology for ideology&rsquo;s sake that even Lucky Linus himself has no patience for. Instead, <em>thank Gourd</em> Mercury&rsquo;s developers took the time to better your social experience! In response to statements like the pullquote above, I expect <strong><em>only</em> thumbs in the air</strong> from this point, forward.</p>

<h3 id="metatexthttpsappsapplecomappmetatextid1523996615"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/metatext/id1523996615">Metatext</a></h3>
<p>Metatext is perhaps the buzziest of all these apps - well-praised in every space I could find conversation on the subject. It&rsquo;s developed under <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jzzocc">Justin Mazzocchi</a>&rsquo;s software studio, <a href="https://metabolist.org/">Metabolist</a> and is as <a href="https://github.com/metabolist/metatext">Open Source</a> as it gets! (As per my hardware keyboard shortcuts crusade, I added <a href="https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/issues/40">my own issue</a> requesting support.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GummyKibble/">u/GummyKibble</a> noted that &ldquo;it looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS.&rdquo; This term - <em>native</em> - seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what it means, and I do agree, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that I speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I think &ldquo;native&rdquo; can be translated as <em>generally of a stout, sturdy disposition</em>, thanks to the care put into honing said balance.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/S6VkSlY0.png" alt="Tootle for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="tootlehttpsappsapplecomusapptootle-for-mastodonid1236013466"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootle-for-mastodon/id1236013466">Tootle</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely positive which Mastodon app was <em>actually</em> the first on my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp">App Store Page</a> Version History suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app - which was apparently &ldquo;Designed for iPad&rdquo; - appears to be working just fine. There are some overlapping UI elements, but they&rsquo;re barely noticeable. Were it not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.</p>
<p>In my search for any extra-App Store representation other than <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp">Tootle&rsquo;s Mastodon Account</a> (which last posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered <a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/11/tootle-l-gtk3-mastodon-client-linux/">Tootle&hellip; for Linux</a>. Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until Lubuntu finally functioned <em>just</em> so I could show you what it looks like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and <em>even</em> wearing the new official Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you&rsquo;ll agree&hellip; Tootle for Linux is not related to Tootle.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Rx3Eu9GA.png" alt="Tootle for Linux"></p>
<p>Personally, I find this a profound shame - I think more apps should be as colorful - and as color <em>configurable</em> - as this little, mysterious Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames embedded above using <em>The Psalms</em> colors, naturally, and the whole process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember doing, all those years ago, and you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard it is to create an unusable color theme. What I find <em>most</em> shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store searches, now. (And by &ldquo;<em>most</em> shame,&rdquo; you know I really mean <em>entirely fucking unacceptable</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="tuskerhttpstestflightapplecomjoinwtb7hyvg"><a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG">Tusker</a></h3>
<p>I found my way to the only <em>currently in-development</em> entry on this list thanks to my Mastodon friend <a href="https://social.wake.st/@liaizon">wakest</a>. iOS developer <a href="https://social.shadowfacts.net/users/shadowfacts">Shadowfacts</a> (who also maintains <a href="https://shadowfacts.net/"><em>shadowfacts.net</em></a>) is working on their considerate, distinct app, Tusker in <a href="https://git.shadowfacts.net/shadowfacts/Tusker">this self-hosted Repository</a>. In <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/timelines/tag/tusker">#tusker</a> on Mastodon, you&rsquo;ll find a few poignant praises from <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> founder and principal developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dansup">Dan Sup</a>, which - from my perspective - are especially high, indeed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jZudSEdQ.png" alt="Tusker Landscape Mode!"></p>
<p>Tusker&rsquo;s color customization options are technically&hellip; well.. <em>not infinite</em>, like other apps here, but the end result of their (obviously, very considered) selection will be a net win for 100% of users over that alternative, I believe. It is definitely of a similar philosophy to Metatext, but unquestionably more ambitious. Out of the lot, testing Tusker was the singular instance in which I found myself considering a &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; for Toot! You, yourself can use Tusker <em>right this very minute</em> via Apple&rsquo;s beta distribution system, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">Testflight</a>, via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG"><strong>this invite link</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/oBYO4T1e.png" alt="Roma for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="romahttpsappsapplecomusapproma-for-pleroma-and-mastodonid1445328699"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roma-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1445328699">Roma</a></h3>
<p>Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast&rsquo;s original developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/JPEGuin">Shihab Meboob</a>, on Twitter, but frankly, I&rsquo;ve already bothered him enough there over the years, so it&rsquo;s understandable that I didn&rsquo;t hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on <a href="https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop">Roma&rsquo;s web page</a> and noticed its similarity to <a href="https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents">Whalebird</a>, I decided to use the site&rsquo;s contact form to <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md">inquire</a> about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I received a reply just <em>minutes</em> later from Leo Radvinsky, head of <a href="https://leo.com/">Leo.com</a>, &ldquo;a Florida-based boutique venture capital fund that invests in technology companies:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It didn&rsquo;t really work out so now we&rsquo;re working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">play.google.com/store/app&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281">apps.apple.com/in/app/fe&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it&rsquo;s no longer supported.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any other questions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing <strong>actual capital</strong> into federated social is certainly worth celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as you&rsquo;re reading this, I insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/4TO8CL5D.png" alt="Fedi for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="fedihttpsappsapplecomusappfedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodonid1478806281"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281">Fedi</a></h3>
<p>Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established by Mast and Roma - known by <em>Fedi</em> - should be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my relative lack of experience with <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> - another ActivityPub-based, federated social network - won&rsquo;t let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi&rsquo;s UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly disregarding my <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791">recently-acquired</a> preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision - to disregard the whole modern template for social apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps' blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very high hopes for Fedi.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Kt8ZbQFk.png" alt="DUDU (嘟嘟) for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="dudu-嘟嘟httpsbitlyduduios"><a href="https://bit.ly/duduios">DUDU (嘟嘟)</a></h3>
<p>DUDU (or &ldquo;嘟嘟,&rdquo; which translates to &ldquo;Toot,&rdquo; appropriately,) definitely wins for <em>Cutest Iconography</em>. It&rsquo;s a non-English-native application with exceptional English support, which I personally appreciate very much. Compared the entries immediately above, DUDU represents a much more modest interpretation of what a Mastodon client can offer. It’s robust, free of over-animation, and - most distinctly - very <em>wide</em>, which might have something to do with the &ldquo;designed for iPad&rdquo; subtitle on its App Store Page.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AZ7fRWc7.png" alt="Tootoise for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="tootoisehttpsappsapplecomusapptootoiseid1465090190"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190">Tootoise</a></h3>
<p>Yet another &ldquo;Designed for iPad&rdquo; entry, Naoki Kuwata&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190">Tootoise</a> is defined by its custom incoming post rate accommodations and its gorgeous Solarized theme. Its &ldquo;Max number of new arrival posts&rdquo; setting ranges from 0-400, allowing one to freeze their timeline entirely from any accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments, anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately apparent when one actually begins to explore it, especially for those who have come to Mastodon after feeling overwhelmed by Big Social.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/LzzNxqj9.png" alt="Stella for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="stellahttpsappsapplecomusappstellaid921372048"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stella/id921372048">Stella</a></h3>
<p>Yet another entirely one-of-a-kind experience, the slightly-mysterious Stella is listed as a &ldquo;Mastodon, Twitter &amp; News Client,&rdquo; and is notably one of the two apps on this list which do indeed support Twitter! More than that, it is the first app I&rsquo;ve seen in a very long time that allows one to <em>simultaneously</em> post to two separate social services (Twitter and Mastodon, in this case.) Without documentation, it&rsquo;s a bit clunky, but its customizable timelines feature also allows one to combine multiple &ldquo;sources&rdquo; (social accounts) into a single timeline.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/aSYoZ8t2.png" alt="B4X for Pleroma & Mastodon for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="b4xhttpsappsapplecomusappb4x-for-pleroma-mastodonid1538396871"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/b4x-for-pleroma-mastodon/id1538396871">B4X</a></h3>
<p>B4X is yet another quite perplexing entry. The &ldquo;Developer Website&rdquo; link on its App Store Page leads to <a href="https://www.b4x.com/contact_us.html">b4x.com</a> - a web page entitled &ldquo;Anywhere Software.&rdquo; The GitHub icon in its footer led me to discover <a href="https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4X-Pleroma">a repository</a> which is labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development space for the iOS app we&rsquo;re discussing, but does not contain a single .swift or .pbxproj file - universally essential for iOS apps, as I understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere Software&rsquo;s &ldquo;rapid application development tools.&rdquo; I like its elemental simplicity and nice &lsquo;n&rsquo; wide post display.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/sFfxE4R7.png" alt="Oyakodon for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="oyakodonhttpsappsapplecomusappoyakodon-for-mastodonid1229174544"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oyakodon-for-mastodon/id1229174544">Oyakodon</a></h3>
<p>Isao Takeyasu&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oyakodon-for-mastodon/id1229174544">Oyakodon</a> feels a bit like it originally began as a school project, and I mean that in the best possible sense. While it’s probably the least polished of the lot - and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client - is is far from a throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu’s mind was clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon’s Facebook-style theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how furious its creator must have been.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AFbihGYF.jpeg" alt="Oyakodon Cute Theme Palette"></p>
<p>Truly diabolical design, there. For better or worse, Oyakodon doesn’t really work very well in its current state, but it <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/D34uONFT.png" alt="StarPterano for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="starpteranohttpsappsapplecomusappstarpteranoid1436972796"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starpterano/id1436972796">StarPterano</a></h3>
<p>I very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very first moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on the App Store - buried as it was - brought me a particular sort of joy. If I’m not mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though, is that it <em>works</em>. On my 12 Pro Max, it’s exceptionally smooth, in fact.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I would imagine those <em>real</em> iOS developers among you should find <a href="https://github.com/pgostation/StarPterano-iOS5">StarPterano’s GitHub Repository</a> particularly interesting, considering. In the interest of preservation, I have <a href="https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/StarPterano">forked it</a> as well, and fully intend to dive in to its code, one of these days. The audio player embedded above cites a three-second .mp3 file in the repository which perhaps once accounted for the “Sounds” toggle still found in the Settings menu of StarPterano’s current build. I couldn’t get the app to reproduce it, which is actually what set me on the hunt that led to the repo.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Ln2L96Qa.png" alt="Ore2 for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="ore2httpsappsapplecomusappore2-for-twitter-mastodonid1107176601"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ore2-for-twitter-mastodon/id1107176601">Ore2</a></h3>
<p>Ore2 is another (apparently) non-English-native Mastodon client focused on consolidating Mastodon and Twitter within a single space. Alongside Stella, it&rsquo;s the second of the first two apps I&rsquo;ve come across in a very long time which allows one to post to both services simultaneously. Considerable work was obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs switchable with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current crossposting configuration via <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br">this (generously-public) web tool</a>, but I am all but certain those users exist who will find Ore2’s setup preferable.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/b0GaeasV.png" alt="tooot for iOS"></p>
<h3 id="tooothttpsappsapplecomusapptoootid1549772269"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269">tooot</a></h3>
<p>Inadvertently, I have saved the best story of the lot for last. Developer and researcher Zhiyuan Zheng documents both the narrative context leading up to the creation of his first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269">tooot</a>, as well as the philosophy behind its design in “<a href="https://xmflsct.com/2021/tooot/">Building my first app - toot</a>.” His reference to the downfall of a prominent social app in mainland China called Douban - and the “Douban Refugees”  which resulted - are alarmingly missing from all English news organizations save for <a href="https://qz.com/1726194/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals/">a single <em>Quartz</em> article</a> from October 2019. He eludes to a “boom” of Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of “user friendly mobile clients” which I can only assume to be a conundrum specific to China.</p>
<p>“With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client for Douban Refugees,” he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a] recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was clearly a major design consideration for tooot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core consists of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I very much appreciate Zhiyuan writing publicly about his thoughts on decentralized social and sharing specific considerations in his app’s design and look forward to continued updates.</p>
<h2 id="get-bent-big-social">Get Bent, Big Social</h2>
<p>A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory mentions. First - in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social counterparts - they are all <em>ridiculously</em> <strong>frugal</strong>. Not a one weighs over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494">often exceed 100mb</a>. They are all astonishingly <strong>robust</strong> - I did not experience a single crash in the course of normal testing these &ldquo;alt&rdquo; social apps- even from the beta builds - while I distinctly remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly <strong>interoperable</strong> by the ActivityPub standard. My <a href="https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue">PixelFed</a> posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from <a href="https://diasp.org/">Diaspora</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, and Mastodon, itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494</a></p>
<p>The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate this? I, David Blue - the vain fucker with a precollection for the most superficial variables of software design <em>so</em> healthy that I have on multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific applications <em>entirely because of their available color palettes</em>&hellip; <strong>It is I who requires you to take a good fucking look</strong>, because this list of decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a goddamned fashion show.</p>
<h2 id="continuing-to-explore-social-ownership">Continuing to Explore Social Ownership</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png" alt="Mastodon Account Wordcloud"></p>
<p>This couldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;just&rdquo; an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It&rsquo;d feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be <em>life-changing</em>, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming &ldquo;official&rdquo; Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing <em>for the user</em>&hellip; None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly <em>infinitely shared</em>. I don&rsquo;t know anything about business, but I <em>do</em> know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it &ldquo;should&rdquo; be.</p>
<p>From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they&rsquo;re far from curious, &ldquo;niche&rdquo; or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these &ldquo;alt&rdquo; social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly <em>and</em> fucking broken. &ldquo;Giving social networking back to you&rdquo; has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!&rsquo;s &ldquo;take a break&rdquo; blue screen, Amaroq&rsquo;s mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast&rsquo;s music app integration, Mercury&rsquo;s configurable timelines, Metatext&rsquo;s native solidity, Tootle&rsquo;s custom colors, Tusker&rsquo;s Digital Wellness controls, DUDU&rsquo;s elemental readability, Roma&rsquo;s quiet resurrection of Mast&rsquo;s UI bravado, Stella&rsquo;s utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi&rsquo;s odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise&rsquo;s consideration of <em>pace</em>, B4X&rsquo;s unfathomable elements, Ore2&rsquo;s parallel timelines, tooot&rsquo;s development story, and Oyakodon&rsquo;s adorable rough edges that have made my online life <em>measurably</em>&hellip; <em>immensely</em> better, these past weeks. At the forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive <em>control</em> over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile experiences these applications offer.</p>
<p>Those of you who haven&rsquo;t yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing the fuck out==. I am being <em>actually</em> pampered, now, in World Wide Web terms. You are <a href="https://bit.ly/dbmastodon"><em>so</em> welcome</a> whenever you&rsquo;re ready - the water is nice and warm, as they say.</p>

<p>Yes, you are looking at the currently in-development <strong>&quot;<em>Official</em>&quot; Mastodon app on iOS</strong>, coming very soon to the Awful App Store. You can join me in testing the app right this very moment by contributing to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">the Mastodon Project&rsquo;s Patreon</a>. Though I do plan to publish <a href="https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-app-review"><strong>a dedicated review</strong></a> on its release date, what I&rsquo;ll say for now is that it&rsquo;s very cute, includes <em>the</em> most gorgeous media player I&rsquo;ve ever seen on an iOS app, and is as distinctly clever as any of the third-party family we&rsquo;ve just visited, all whilst maintaining an expert&rsquo;s aim at its evangelist purpose.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>The surprise that threw me over the edge to a genuinely pitiful extent: the official Mastodon app already includes full <strong>Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts integration on iPhone!</strong></p>

<h2 id="native-as-fuck-might-be-out-of-style-but-who-can-afford-redundancy-not-i">Native As Fuck might be out of style, but who can afford redundancy? Not I.</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly, the most creatively productive person in my family is my brother-in-law, <a href="https://twitter.com/los_gabriel">Carlos Gabriel Ruiz</a>, who somehow manages to take care of a houseold, raise a preteen son, work a full-time iOS dev job of the most tedious, high-grade sort, <em>and</em> churn out <a href="https://www.carlosgabrielruiz.com">visual and written work</a> on a regular basis. Have <em>you</em> ever seen quite so many vertical bars in a personal site title? I don’t think <em>I</em> have, and I know they’re legitimate. Something he told me last year has been on my mind nearly every day, since: his preferred word processor is Ye Olde FinalDraft, in which he still uses the same templates he configured in college. (That was quite a while ago.) I’ve thought about it just about every day, since, as I’ve spent an inquantifiable amount of time Just Fucking Around with my “workflow,” and reading other professional accounts of Just Fucking Around with workflows[^1] these past eighteen months. Do I spend more time configuring my writing spaces than <em>actually writing</em> because I have nothing to say? (I’m going to be interspersing embedded screenshots throughout this post that may or may not have something to do with the nearby contents. Sorry, I just captured far too many.)</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153780995-5b7ac09d-4c21-4e61-b1ba-163ce106fb01.png" alt="Black&YellowTheme"></p>
<p>I tried Obsidian. In fact - and I&rsquo;m still not one hundred percent positive about this - I&rsquo;m pretty sure I first tried Obsidian several years ago, though the Obsidian.md domain only stretches back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200410075559/https://obsidian.md/">April of 2020</a>, so I might just be nuts. Regardless, something said by <em>MacStories</em> founder and Definitive iPad Professional, Federico Viticci, in an issue of <em>MacStories Weekly</em> from late Summer really&hellip; jutted out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its core, Obsidian is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you&rsquo;re ready to get started. The app is based on web technologies, which means it is highly customizable. Obsidian supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app&rsquo;s vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app&rsquo;s functionality. The app&rsquo;s primary views are its editor and preview mode, which can be split into multiple panes both vertically and horizontally. Obsidian also supports saved workspaces that allow users to open a predefined group of notes easily, commands for quickly opening documents and accessing the app&rsquo;s features, along with extensive, customizable keyboard shortcut support. Of course, notes can be linked internally, allowing for the creation of a wiki-like web of documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the interim, I&rsquo;ve reviewed these few sentences over and over again, trying to find the discrepancy, but basically the core of my issue is that <strong>Federico is describing <em>Drafts</em> as I know it, word for word</strong>. In fact, since you&rsquo;re here, bear with me just a second as I misquote him to an imperial degree, replacing the word &ldquo;Obsidian&rdquo; with &ldquo;Drafts:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its core, Drafts is a Markdown text editor.

</blockquote>
<p>Now, there are several points I probably wouldn&rsquo;t <em>start out with</em> when describing Drafts, but not one of these statements is wholly untrue, either. While you absolutely can &ldquo;point [Drafts] to a folder on your iPhone or iPad&rdquo; and be ready to &ldquo;get started,&rdquo; <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks">Folder Bookmarks</a> <em>are</em> a fairly recent feature for Drafts, and not exactly configured <em>out of the box</em>. It is not - nor will it ever be - local filesystem-based like Obsidian, but honestly - especially as an iCloud+ subscriber with 2TB of iCloud Storage - I&rsquo;m not sure this should be left as a detriment. Though I use a Git-enabled system to track revisions (which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/">I basically learned from Federico</a>!,) I&rsquo;ve honestly had much more success configuring bookmark-enabled file actions tied to specific folders and keyboard shortcuts than I did running off the filesystem with Obsidian for the few months-long period I gave it a shot, last year.[^2] More on that in a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153721368-59fbb89f-46ff-46da-8caf-8d24047e3589.png" alt="SpaceTakenbyDrafts"></p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>I’m also not entirely sure I’d feel honest describing <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">the Drafts community</a> as it stands as “vibrant.” We’re more like&hellip; “bitchy or extremely helpful,” but such a transition seems to be inevitable in the lifecycle of any given text editor/word processor. There is still a single man, <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/gnu-nano-6-0-released/">whittling away on nano</a>, and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/bearapp">Bear’s Subreddit</a> may very well be the bitchiest spot on the bitchiest site on the bitchiest net in history. My <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1494040559161421827">pitch to Greg Pierce</a> for the creation of a Drafts-specific Discord or Telegram channel has apparently fallen flat, perhaps for the better. The Drafts Forums have their own vibrancy, and it’s in a few key folks - like Stephen Millard, for instance, and Greg, himself - who will jump in within a matter of minutes or hours to address even the most facepalmy questions. (Describing many of my own.)</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153950328-e0e71931-d407-469f-a882-b9566f37399c.png" alt="ReminderIntegrations"></p>
<p>Not just in support, but in requests. I think <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/posting-to-mastodon-from-drafts-native-action-service/12089">my inquiry into the possibility of native Mastodon posting support</a> offers a profound example. Within a matter of hours, Greg responded with <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1v8">an actual, working Post to Mastodon action</a> and another pro-dev user joined the conversation with an account of their recent attempts to modify Greg’s own <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Hu">Tweet Storm action</a> for Mastodon. Notably, 1.) this was a <em>Sunday morning</em> and 2.) this was <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400">not the first request of mine</a> which Greg had fulfilled almost immediately upon prompt <em>just that weekend</em>. Then, there’s the innumerable email threads between Greg and I discussing - what else - <a href="https://uikeycommand.com">keyboard shortcuts support on iPhone</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154821804-3d6d90b4-76d4-4082-a4dc-7dde5631c296.png" alt="TipCalculatorLandscape"></p>
<p>I distinctly remember one such thread that resolved a ridiculous and mild panic I’d been set in when I accidentally disabled Background App Refresh for Drafts, which caused a hullabaloo, as you might imagine. I didn’t think to check the Settings app until we were 4 replies and one whole morning deep. Obviously, I was deeply embarrassed - so much so that I actually considered lying about the cause - but I told him the truth and received the most patient <em>no problem, good to know</em> in the history of the world. When Stephen Millard’s Thought Asylum actions ceased functioning in my library, I posted <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/script-error-syntaxerror-json-parse-error-unexpected-identifier-drafts-line-number-53-column-35/12187">a reply in the forums</a>, which led to both Greg and Stephen’s help in resolving the issue within hours.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153778986-a9a33a80-12a3-4042-8941-2e2d5e427703.png" alt="BookmarksinDrafts"></p>
<p>I’m not sure if Federico and company still use Git to collaborate between each other, but I continue to do so <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/drafts/">publicly</a>. In fact, it’s more likely than not you can still see <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/drafts/On%20Drafts%20and%20Obsidian.md#L0">this very draft I’m whittling on</a> - along with its entire composition/revision history - whenever you’re reading, given how often I forget to move completed work from <code>drafts/</code> to <code>posts/</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154865771-47d8565b-424f-477e-b664-770a1b0d2fb1.png" alt="Find & Replace with Regular Expressions"></p>
<p>I’m one hundred percent positive I spent far, <em>far</em> more time reading about and updating plugins than I did actually <em>writing</em> in Obsidian. Just now, I finally rid my repository of the last of their files, and they numbered almost one <em>thousand</em>. Just configuration files. Participation in the fiddling was fun and exciting, but it didn’t exactly lend well to productivity. I found myself in a very specific cycle: whenever a new functionaility or integration was shouted about in Obsidian, I would search to see if it already existed in Drafts. It sounds ridiculous, but I tell you I did not find a single case where my findings were not at least “equivalent” to what Obsidian users/developers had rigged up - in the vast majority of cases, I found them vastly more ideal, more robust, and better documented. Eventually, I dropped Obsidian altogether and honestly, <a href="https://bilge.world/drafts-zalgo-action">I’m still going</a> down that path without it, entirely.</p>
<p>There is tremendous value in the hype surrounding whatever writing app is currently trending. A trip not so far back in the <em>MacStories</em> archives reveals that just <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/compiling-and-exporting-tagged-notes-in-drafts-5">four years ago or so</a>, Drafts was having its’ own moment <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/interview-greg-pierce-1">after the release of Drafts 5</a>. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">Tim Nahumck&rsquo;s review for <em>MacStories</em></a> was quite celebratory. Rosemary Orchard - undeniably the queen of automation on Apple Devices - also <a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-drafts-5-review/">praised it in her review</a>. I can tell you that no major release of any Windows application I use regularly has ever gotten such attention as Drafts 5, even - at least, not in my lifetime. Perhaps this is for the better, but I think not. Anyway, that topic is for <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/292">another time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will always be advantages to being fully native on the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said Greg Pierce, Drafts creator, quoting from <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/interview-greg-pierce-1">his 2018 interview with <em>MacStories</em></a>. When I hear “fully native,” I think of Drafts, of course, but also <a href="http://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447">Bear</a> - all three of which are coded mostly in Objective C, if I’m not mistaken. I think of them as the most robust third-party applications I’ve ever used on any platform. Among Drafts specific advantages as a native app are <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">direct Siri Shortcuts integration</a>, extensive <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/urlschemes">URL scheme/x-callback-url support</a>[^3], the best <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/sync">iCloud syncing</a> I’ve ever seen from any application on iOS and macOS, a legendary share sheet-bound <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/share">web capture extension</a>, the ability to send full draft contents from <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/message">an iMessage app</a>, an award-winning <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/applewatch">Apple Watch app</a>, gorgeous, configurable, and actually useful(!) <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/widgets">widgets</a>, and even iOS and macOS <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/notifications">icon badge support</a>, among an extensive list of others.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153966641-fad3a074-4938-4cef-b1c8-ed900cd8599c.png" alt="ControllingBearfromDrafts"></p>
<h2 id="sending">Sending</h2>
<p>For instance, with a single keyboard shortcut (<code>^M</code>,) I can send the full contents of my current draft to an email address of my choice without leaving the app. Using an Email-to-Post address (which <em>The Psalms</em> does in fact have,) this would mean publishing with that single shortcut. The same also applies to sending via SMS (<code>⌥M</code>, if you care to know.)[^4] I was able to configure these vie the public <a href="https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail">Mail Action Wizard</a> and <a href="https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/message">Messages Action Wizard</a>, respectively, and they work across iOS, iPadOS and macOS, out of the box, incredibly. I also used the latter to configure an action which sends messages to my <a href="https://bilge.world/ios-15-family-review">Family Tech Support iMessage group</a> - a mix of 10 digit phone numbers and email addresses - astonishingly easily. It sends messages with the current draft title as the subject line and the body text as the message body.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154845607-1dc5e1c5-759a-4030-84ab-d609491f7acb.png" alt="Sending Drafts from iMessage"></p>
<p>If I couldn’t be bothered with configuring my own actions, I could use the aforementioned iMessage App to send whole drafts to whomever. (I just noticed that even <em>it</em> reflects the current theme.) Note in the screenshot embedded above the header that one can not only <em>send</em> draft contents to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447">Bear</a>, but they can actually <em>command</em> virtually all of the configurable editor settings from within Drafts. This is enabled via the also aforementioned URL scheme and x-callback-url support in Drafts.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155904725-8489c896-adfc-4f43-8901-eb897ab998e4.png" alt="Terminology Draft"></p>
<p>Similarly is Drafts’ integration with another Agile Tortoise app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859">Terminology Dictionary</a>. As I noted in my <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/terminology">App Store review</a>, I’ve set up a ridiculously easy and enjoyable integration involving a keyboard shortcut (^⇧D) to send selected words to Terminology, where I have set up a button in the primary top bar with the default “Drafts (definitions)” action, relying on this scheme:</p>
<p><code>drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]</code></p>
<p>This creates a new draft of a given term with its definitions, along with any notes I’ve entered to accompany it. (An example result is shown in the screenshot embedded above.) Crucially - as I also mentioned the aforelinked review - Terminology allows me to enter <em>my own terms</em> that may or may not necessarily return from established dictionaries, this way, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155905726-ffa126d6-ccb5-497f-a80c-51ba457b1330.png" alt="aforelinked in Terminology"></p>
<p>This is contrasted with the popular app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448">LookUp</a> (which I also own,) which only allows one to save terms returned from search. Obviously, this doesn’t exclude entering words by way of <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/09609fefe91340e0b4f07df5b332cafc">its Shortcuts action</a>, which makes said action virtually useless, from my view.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155922296-4c00c372-8b79-4dfd-b421-5d718845a782.png" alt="LookUp Failure"></p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of dictionaries - one of my favorites from <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/tadpole/">Stephen Millard’s ThoughtAsylum action library</a> is <code>Replace with Synonym</code>, which I’ve tied to <code>^⌥S</code>. On either a selected word or a single-word draft, keying this shortcut brings up the prompt shown in the screenshot embedded below:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153939391-c92f75c1-1313-4ead-96fa-c6ef0927a59d.png" alt="SynonymsWithaKeyboardShortcut"></p>
<p>I’m assuming the action uses the iOS system dictionary, which is great, but deserves an app in and of itself as it has on macOS, in my opinion.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154817269-0713a89d-d1a0-46a1-b2ed-57a84abddff8.png" alt="ExportPsalmsActionsLandscape"></p>
<h2 id="systemworking-copy-folder-access">System/Working Copy Folder Access</h2>
<p>With my current Drafts setup, I need only hit <code>⇧^⌥D</code> to push my current draft to <em>The Psalms</em>’ <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/drafts/">drafts folder</a> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> - the golden standard iOS Git client. The same applies with the keyboard shortcut <code>⇧^⌥N</code> and the corresponding notes draft and the <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/notes/">/notes repo folder</a>. On my iPhone, I’m currently switching back and forth between these using <code>⌥3</code> and <code>⌥4</code>, respectfully. If you’d like to see, here are those two (unlisted actions) on the Drafts Action Directory: <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wL">Export Psalms Drafts</a> &amp; <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wM">Export Psalms Notes</a>. I also have <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wN">an action</a> that saves to a root iCloud Drive folder as a .md file called “Written” with the keyboard command <code>⌥⌘S</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155971770-907a90aa-c955-4928-bbad-6cd1a61216ea.png" alt="Written Folder"></p>
<p>If one wished, they could output web-read HTML files this way via a similarly-configured action with <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/previews">Drafts’ templates</a>, which would make it awfully easy to publish whole website updates directly from Drafts. Of course, I’ve heard good things about <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian’s own publishing service</a>, though none of the examples I could find in the gallery were scrollable on my iPhone or particularly breathtaking[^5].</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156826733-4e596f5f-2f90-4e88-977e-fb6dc8f9c218.png" alt="Obsidian Publish Example"></p>
<p>Regarding using Git with Drafts via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a>, it’s actually possible to do so <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/setup-drafts-on-ios-with-working-copy/9197">pre-Drafts File Bookmarks</a>, if you’d like. I ran with this setup for a while in 2020, the results of which you can inspect, still, on <a href="https://github.com/extratone/drafts">my Drafts-specific GitHub Repository</a>. From what I remember it’s quite similar in many ways to running Obsidian directly off a Working Copy repository - both can be iCloud synced and still have all revisions tracked.</p>

<p>After a while, however, I realized that I was perfectly happy with <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/versionhistory">Drafts’ native versioning system</a> in the majority of projects and that it most often resulted in much quicker/easier access to previous draft versions that Git could possibly enable. I’ve recently taken to occasionally saving versions manually with the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1YL">Save Version action</a> tied to <code>⌘⇧S</code>. Combined with the export actions I showcased above, I trust my current Drafts setup more than I’ve ever trusted any of the writing environments I’ve lived in, which is really saying something.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154896941-f15cfe59-dd8f-4310-b4be-fe55ee4e4bc7.PNG" alt="WindowsEternal-iPadPro"></p>
<h2 id="management-and-navigation">Management and Navigation</h2>
<p>One of the absolute core differences between Drafts and native filesystem-based applications like Obsidian is the fundamental way notes are organized. I’ll quote this particularly succinct passage <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/drafts/">from the documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drafts has a lightweight organization system similar to email. Individual drafts are created in the “Inbox”. When a draft has been processed, it can be moved to the Archive to long term storage or the Trash if it no longer needed. A draft can also, optionally, be flagged and have any number of tags assigned to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chronology is the primary sortation method by default - by creation date, last modified date, or last accessed date. Drafts and Bear share the basic principle, as you’ll note in the screenshot embedded below - the two writing applications which have had the greatest influence on my thinking. It’s important to mention this, I think, because there’s a very real possibility I have been too embedded in the core methodology of these systems for too long to be critical of them and am blinded to the full spectrum of advantages inherent to directly editing text files in the filesystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158259554-5191b921-8064-4ac6-8720-f9c5fa3c67b8.png" alt="Notes Organization - Drafts vs Bear"></p>
<p>Around this time two years ago, however, my computing life was still very much Windows desktop-first. I had found myself delivered to markdown stupidly late in life - not in actual use of the syntax, but in knowing it by name - by way of <a href="https://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history">my own very misplaced hype</a> surrounding Dropbox’s then-new web-based WYSIWYG text editor frontend, <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com">Paper</a>.[^6]</p>
<p>Before I began to experiment with <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/245">the Git-atop methodology</a> that now underpins <em>The Psalms</em>, there was a brief period I barely recall during which my whole process was <em>just</em> directly editing plain markdown text files living locally on my Surface Laptop 2 with a younger, pre-release build of <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a>. What <em>does</em> certainly stand out, in hindsight, is how much work I consistently published over that time</p>
<h2 id="theming">Theming</h2>
<p>Some of Obsidian’s themes are quite gorgeous, no doubt, but - once again - there’s nothing quite like those of a <em>native app</em> to get the stylistic hunger going. I must admit my knowledge of the theme creation process for Obsidian is virtually nill, but I think it’s indicative of Drafts’ malleability that I was able to create <a href="https://extratone.github.io/drafts/">such beautiful themes</a> with zero knowledge of anything but CSS and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jayson/id1468691718">the handiest JSON manipulation tool, anywhere</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156087079-abad2f15-5f83-438d-9c96-cf8ee7d7c4c7.png" alt="ENCOM Widgets"></p>
<p>Once again, thanks to Drafts’ indigenousness, its widgets, too, can be themed. (This is not something I discovered until recently, re-reading the “<a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/development/theme-format">Creating Themes</a>” article. Notably, <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles">Obsidian’s equivalent</a> is quite lackluster.) Above is an embedded screenshot of two widgets bearing the look of my newest Drafts theme, <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/t/1wg">ENCOM</a>. I’m <a href="https://whyp.it/t/on-widgets-54991">not much of a widgets person</a>, but it’s hard not to leave Drafts’ around, somewhere, given how beautiful they look.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1498412135268982784">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1498412135268982784</a></p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>I’m writing this portion from a first-generation <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air">iPad Air</a> I just inherited, which dates back to late 2013 and iOS 9. I’ve found some surprising delights within its last supported OS - 12.5.5 - and one of them has been Drafts’ support of that OS, up to Drafts version 26.3.5. (I just switched back to my 12 Pro Max and found everything instantly synced.) Most of the features I’m using in Drafts 31 on the latter device are still present. All of my actions and their corresponding keyboard shortcuts function and all of my themes are present, as are, naturally, my 1600+ drafts. As I noted in the Tweet embedded above, this all took less than ten minutes to sync <em>while I was doing other shit</em>.</p>
<p>The threshold of this backwards compatibility lies somewhere between iOS 9 and 12 - I know because I was <em>not</em> able to download Drafts on the iPhone 4S recently given to me by a friend. Unfortunately, my purchases of pre-5.0 Drafts versions are on another Apple account for which I no longer have the password. I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if I could get Drafts 1.0 or 2.0 running on that phone, had I access. Obsidian’s iOS compatibility also goes back to 12.1, though I found it particularly sticky to use on my iPad Air, if that makes sense. This is understandable, or at least it would be, were both Drafts and Bear not entirely smooth and functional on the same hardware.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compatibility">Cross-Compatibility</h2>
<p>Drafts’ cross-compatibility is perhaps its (and native apps, in general) weakest link. Full interaction with Drafts can be done on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, but not Windows, nor will the prospect of doing so on the latter ever be realistic. Drafts’ <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/web-capture">Web Capture utility</a> enables drafts to be <em>created</em> from anywhere, however, and I - a Windows user, still - have found it genuinely useful.</p>
<p>By contrast, Obsidian can run on virtually anything, including Windows machines. On a git repository, version tracking is also completely cross-compatible, obviously.</p>
<h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>
<p>Though this inadvertently turned into a sort of half-review of Drafts/showcase of my own Drafts setup, I really intended to highlight a single concern regarding this whole comparison: <strong>redundancy</strong>. <em>To Each His Own</em> is the classic counter-argument I’ve gotten when I’ve brought this up, but - as a Windows user, especially - the wealth of development time being (forgive me) squandered off in the direction of Obsidian without a single clear voice saying “holdup” is just a painful thing to witness. My desire in spending all this time writing is to perhaps prompt a “<em>wait, haven’t we already done this?</em>” among prospective third-party users/user-developers.</p>
<p>One might say the same of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273">Taio</a>, which is another flavor of the files app-driven iOS text editor, but it’s being built by a single person on a particular bent. A Mastodon mutual of mine <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@CutThroatNeko/107925765618277225">declared Taio to be the best markdown app</a>. My favorite App Store review of Taio is subtitled “Like Obsidian ++&hellip;”</p>

<p>NAME
curl - transfer a URL</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS
curl [options / URLs]</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION
curl  is  a  tool for transfering data from or to a server. It supports
these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,  HTTPS,
IMAP,  IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP,
SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET or TFTP. The command  is  designed
to work without user interaction.</p>
<pre><code>   curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-
   tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-
   fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
   make your head spin!

   curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See
   libcurl(3) for details.
</code></pre>
<p>URL
The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You&rsquo;ll find a detailed descrip-
tion in RFC 3986.</p>
<pre><code>   You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets
   within braces and quoting the URL as in:

     &quot;http://site.{one,two,three}.com&quot;

   or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt&quot;

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt&quot;    (with leading zeros)

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt&quot;

   Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next
   to each other:

     &quot;http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html&quot;

   You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be
   fetched  in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify
   command line options and URLs mixed and in any  order  on  the  command
   line.

   You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
   or letter:

     &quot;http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt&quot;

     &quot;http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt&quot;

   When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,
   you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
   shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters
   treated special, like for example '&amp;', '?' and '*'.

   Provide  the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign
   and the interface name. Like in

     &quot;http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/&quot;

   If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to
   guess  what  protocol  you might want. It will then default to HTTP but
   try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam-
   ple,  for  host names starting with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to
   speak FTP.

   curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not
   trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but
   is instead very liberal with what it accepts.

   curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
   that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con-
   nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
   files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between
   separate curl invocations.
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT
If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It  can
be  instructed  to  instead save that data into a local file, using the
-o, &ndash;output or -O, &ndash;remote-name options. If curl  is  given  multiple
URLs  to  transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple op-
tions for where to save them.</p>
<pre><code>   curl does not parse or otherwise &quot;understand&quot; the content  it  gets  or
   writes  as  output.  It does no encoding or decoding, unless explicitly
   asked to with dedicated command line options.
</code></pre>
<p>PROTOCOLS
curl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL  terms:  schemes.  Your
particular build may not support them all.</p>
<pre><code>   DICT   Lets you lookup words using online dictionaries.

   FILE   Read  or  write  local  files.  curl  does not support accessing
          file:// URL remotely, but when running on Microsoft Windows  us-
          ing the native UNC approach will work.

   FTP(S) curl  supports  the  File Transfer Protocol with a lot of tweaks
          and levers. With or without using TLS.

   GOPHER(S)
          Retrieve files.

   HTTP(S)
          curl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It  can
          speak HTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2 and 3 depending on build op-
          tions and the correct command line options.

   IMAP(S)
          Using the mail reading protocol, curl can &quot;download&quot; emails  for
          you. With or without using TLS.

   LDAP(S)
          curl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.

   MQTT   curl supports MQTT version 3. Downloading over MQTT equals &quot;sub-
          scribe&quot; to a topic while uploading/posting equals &quot;publish&quot; on a
          topic. MQTT over TLS is not supported (yet).

   POP3(S)
          Downloading  from  a  pop3  server means getting a mail. With or
          without using TLS.

   RTMP(S)
          The Realtime Messaging Protocol  is  primarily  used  to  server
          streaming media and curl can download it.

   RTSP   curl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.

   SCP    curl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.

   SFTP   curl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.

   SMB(S) curl supports SMB version 1 for upload and download.

   SMTP(S)
          Uploading  contents  to  an  SMTP server means sending an email.
          With or without TLS.

   TELNET Telling curl to fetch a telnet URL starts an interactive session
          where  it  sends  what  it  reads  on stdin and outputs what the
          server sends it.

   TFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.
</code></pre>
<p>PROGRESS METER
curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating
the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time
left, etc. The progress meter displays number of bytes and  the  speeds
are  in  bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based.
For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.</p>
<pre><code>   curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke
   curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
   it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
   mixing progress meter and response data.

   If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
   redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (&gt;),  -o,
   --output or similar.

   This  does  not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
   any response data to the terminal.

   If you prefer a progress  &quot;bar&quot;  instead  of  the  regular  meter,  -#,
   --progress-bar  is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
   completely with the -s, --silent option.
</code></pre>
<p>OPTIONS
Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an
additional value next to them.</p>
<pre><code>   The  short  &quot;single-dash&quot;  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
   used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
   is a recommended separator. The long &quot;double-dash&quot; form, -d, --data for
   example, requires a space between it and its value.

   Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used
   immediately  next  to  each other, like for example you can specify all
   the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

   In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
   disabled  with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option name
   but prefix it with &quot;no-&quot;. However, in this list we mostly only list and
   show  the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was
   added in 7.19.0. Previously most options were  toggled  on/off  through
   repeated use of the same command line option.)

   --abstract-unix-socket &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead
          of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-
          stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the &lt;path&gt; argument
          should not have this leading character.

          Example:
           curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

          Added in 7.53.0.

   --alt-svc &lt;file name&gt;
          (HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl.  If  the
          file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be
          used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the
          file name again if it has been modified.

          Specify a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
          make curl just handle the cache in memory.

          If this option is used several times, curl  will  load  contents
          from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

          Example:
           curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.64.1.

   --anyauth
          (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
          and use the most secure one the remote site claims  to  support.
          This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
          headers, thus possibly inducing  an  extra  network  round-trip.
          This  is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific authentication
          method, which you can do with  --basic,  --digest,  --ntlm,  and
          --negotiate.

          Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
          since it may require data to be sent twice and then  the  client
          must  be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading
          from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

          Used together with -u, --user.

          Example:
           curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com

          See also --proxy-anyauth, --basic and --digest.

   -a, --append
          (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
          target  file  instead  of  overwriting  it.  If  the remote file
          doesn't exist, it will be created.  Note that this flag  is  ig-
          nored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

          Example:
           curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/

   --aws-sigv4 &lt;provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]&gt;
          Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

          The  provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm
          when creating outgoing authentication headers.

          The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area
          of  a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
          omitted from the endpoint.

          The service argument is a string that points to a function  pro-
          vided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted
          from the endpoint.

          Example:
           curl --aws-sigv4 &quot;aws:amz:east-2:es&quot; --user &quot;key:secret&quot; https://example.com

          Added in 7.75.0.

   --basic
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the  re-
          mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-
          less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that
          sets  a  different  authentication method (such as --ntlm, --di-
          gest, or --negotiate).

          Used together with -u, --user.

          Example:
           curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com

          See also --proxy-basic.

   --cacert &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
          the  peer.  The  file  may contain multiple CA certificates. The
          certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built  to
          use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
          alter that default file.

          curl recognizes the environment variable named  'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
          if  it  is  set,  and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert
          bundle. This option overrides that variable.

          The windows version of curl will automatically  look  for  a  CA
          certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
          tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
          folder along your PATH.

          If  curl  is  built  against  the  NSS  SSL library, the NSS PEM
          PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-
          tion to work properly.

          (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
          then this option is supported for  backward  compatibility  with
          other  SSL  engines,  but it should not be set. If the option is
          not set, then curl will use the certificates in the  system  and
          user  Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred method
          of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

          (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows
          7  or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is supported
          for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
          recommended  to use Windows' store of root certificates (the de-
          fault for Schannel).

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com

   --capath &lt;dir&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
          verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
          them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.  &quot;path1:path2:path3&quot;). The certificates must
          be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-
          rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-
          plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
          curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
          --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

          If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored,
          and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com

   --cert-status
          (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate
          by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
          extension.

          If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.
          expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
          tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,
          the verification fails.

          This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
          NSS backends.

          Example:
           curl --cert-status https://example.com

          Added in 7.41.0.

   --cert-type &lt;type&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl what type the provided  client  certificate  is
          using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.  If not spec-
          ified, PEM is assumed.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com

          See also -E, --cert, --key and --key-type.

   -E, --cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified  client  certificate  file
          when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
          col. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if  using  Secure
          Transport,  or PEM format if using any other engine.  If the op-
          tional password isn't specified, it will be queried for  on  the
          terminal.  Note  that  this  option assumes a &quot;certificate&quot; file
          that is the private key and the client certificate concatenated!
          See -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.

          If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
          can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
          NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
          default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
          nsspem.so)  is  available  then  PEM files may be loaded. If you
          want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it
          with  &quot;./&quot;  prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.
          If the nickname contains &quot;:&quot;, it needs to be preceded by &quot;\&quot;  so
          that  it  is not recognized as password delimiter.  If the nick-
          name contains &quot;\&quot;, it needs to be escaped as &quot;\\&quot; so that it  is
          not recognized as an escape character.

          If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
          is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
          ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
          ning with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
          PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
          &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be
          set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.

          (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
          then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-
          cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to
          a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to
          use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with
          &quot;./&quot; prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

          (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path
          expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-
          ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use &quot;&lt;store
          location&gt;\&lt;store  name&gt;\&lt;thumbprint&gt;&quot;  to refer to a certificate
          in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   &quot;Curren-
          tUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a&quot;.   Thumbprint
          is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate
          details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,
          LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,
          LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com

          See also --cert-type, --key and --key-type.

   --ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
          of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read  up  on  SSL  cipher
          list details on this URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com

   --compressed-ssh
          (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,
          not an order; the server may or may not do it.

          Example:
           curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.56.0.

   --compressed
          (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
          curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Headers
          are not modified.

          If this option is used and the server sends an  unsupported  en-
          coding, curl will report an error. This is a request, not an or-
          der; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

          Example:
           curl --compressed https://example.com

   -K, --config &lt;file&gt;

          Specify a text file to read curl  arguments  from.  The  command
          line  arguments  found  in the text file will be used as if they
          were provided on the command line.

          Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  line
          in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
          Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config  file
          without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals
          characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified
          with  one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals charac-
          ter between the option and its parameter.

          If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with  :  or  =),
          the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within quotes. Within double
          quotes, the following escape sequences are  available:  \\,  \&quot;,
          \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-
          nored.

          If the first column of a config line is  a  '#'  character,  the
          rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

          Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

          Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read
          the file from stdin.

          Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
          need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
          writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
          this:

          url = &quot;https://curl.se/docs/&quot;

          When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks
          for a default config file and uses it if found, even  when  this
          option  is  used.  The default config file is checked for in the
          following places in this order:

          1) Use the CURL_HOME environment variable if set

          2) Use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable if set (Added in
          7.73.0)

          3) Use the HOME environment variable if set

          4) Non-windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

          5) Windows: use APPDATA if set

          6) Windows: use &quot;USERPROFILE\Application Data&quot; if set

          7)  On  windows, if there is no .curlrc file in the home dir, it
          checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On
          Unix-like  systems,  it will simply try to load .curlrc from the
          determined home dir.

          # --- Example file ---
          # this is a comment
          url = &quot;example.com&quot;
          output = &quot;curlhere.html&quot;
          user-agent = &quot;superagent/1.0&quot;

          # and fetch another URL too
          url = &quot;example.com/docs/manpage.html&quot;
          -O
          referer = &quot;http://nowhereatall.example.com/&quot;
          # --- End of example file ---

          This option can be used multiple times to load  multiple  config
          files.

          Example:
           curl --config file.txt https://example.com

   --connect-timeout &lt;fractional seconds&gt;
          Maximum  time  in  seconds  that  you allow curl's connection to
          take.  This only limits the connection phase, so  if  curl  con-
          nects  within the given period it will continue - if not it will
          exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.
          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
           curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com

          See also -m, --max-time.

   --connect-to &lt;HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2&gt;

          For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to
          HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests
          at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-
          ter  of  servers. This option is only used to establish the net-
          work connection. It does NOT affect the  hostname/port  that  is
          used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
          application protocols. &quot;HOST1&quot; and  &quot;PORT1&quot;  may  be  the  empty
          string, meaning &quot;any host/port&quot;. &quot;HOST2&quot; and &quot;PORT2&quot; may also be
          the  empty  string,  meaning   &quot;use   the   request's   original
          host/port&quot;.

          A &quot;host&quot; specified to this option is compared as a string, so it
          needs to match the name used in request URL. It  can  be  either
          numerical such as &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; or the full host name such as &quot;ex-
          ample.org&quot;.

          This option can be used many times to add many connect rules.

          Example:
           curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

          See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.

   -C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
          Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at  the  given  offset.
          The  given  offset  is  the  exact  number of bytes that will be
          skipped, counting from the beginning of the source  file  before
          it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the
          FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

          Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell curl to automatically find out  where/how  to
          resume  the  transfer. It then uses the given output/input files
          to figure that out.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -C - https://example.com
           curl -C 400 https://example.com

          See also -r, --range.

   -c, --cookie-jar &lt;filename&gt;
          (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cookies
          after  a  completed  operation. Curl writes all cookies from its
          in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of  opera-
          tions.  If  no  cookies  are known, no data will be written. The
          file will be written using the Netscape cookie file  format.  If
          you set the file name to a single dash, &quot;-&quot;, the cookies will be
          written to stdout.

          This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
          makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
          to use the -b, --cookie option.

          If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl
          operation  won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v,
          --verbose will get a warning displayed, but  that  is  the  only
          visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

          If  this  option  is used several times, the last specified file
          name will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
           curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com

   -b, --cookie &lt;data|filename&gt;
          (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
          is  supposedly the data previously received from the server in a
          &quot;Set-Cookie:&quot;  line.   The  data  should  be   in   the   format
          &quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.

          If  no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated
          as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
          also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-
          coming cookies, which may be handy if you're using this in  com-
          bination  with  the  -L,  --location  option  or do multiple URL
          transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a  mi-
          nus (&quot;-&quot;), curl will instead read the contents from stdin.

          The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
          HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
          file format.

          The  file  specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No
          cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
          -c, --cookie-jar option.

          If you use the Set-Cookie file format and don't specify a domain
          then the cookie is not sent since the domain will  never  match.
          To  address  this,  set  a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing that
          will include sub-domains) or preferably: use the  Netscape  for-
          mat.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and write
          updated cookies back to a file, so using both -b,  --cookie  and
          -c, --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.

          Examples:
           curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
           curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com

   --create-dirs
          When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
          create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
          option  creates  the directories mentioned with the -o, --output
          option, nothing else. If the --output file name uses  no  direc-
          tory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no direc-
          tories will be created.

          Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.
          To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
          create-dirs.

          Example:
           curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com

   --create-file-mode &lt;mode&gt;
          (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using
          one of the supported protocols, this option allows the  user  to
          set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of
          the default 0644.

          This option takes an octal number as argument.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new

          See also --ftp-create-dirs. Added in 7.75.0.

   --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS
          (OS/390).

          (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

          Example:
           curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/

   --crlfile &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-
          tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-
          sidered revoked.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.7.

   --curves &lt;algorithm list&gt;
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL
          session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.  Multiple  al-
          gorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.
          &quot;X25519:P-521&quot;).  The parameter is available identically in  the
          &quot;openssl s_client/s_server&quot; utilities.

          --curves  allows  a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections
          with exactly the (EC) curve requested by  the  client,  avoiding
          intransparent client/server negotiations.

          If  this  option  is  set,  the  default  curves list built into
          openssl will be ignored.

          Example:
           curl --curves X25519 https://example.com

          Added in 7.73.0.

   --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.

          Example:
           curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com

   --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no  extra  pro-
          cessing whatsoever.

          If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
          filename.  Data is posted in a  similar  manner  as  -d,  --data
          does,  except  that  newlines and carriage returns are preserved
          and conversions are never done.

          Like -d, --data the default content-type sent to the  server  is
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  If  you  want the data to be
          treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-
          tent-type  to octet-stream: -H &quot;Content-Type: application/octet-
          stream&quot;.

          If this option is used several times,  the  ones  following  the
          first will append data as described in -d, --data.

          Example:
           curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com

   --data-raw &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP)  This  posts data similarly to -d, --data but without the
          special interpretation of the @ character.

          Examples:
           curl --data-raw &quot;hello&quot; https://example.com
           curl --data-raw &quot;@at@at@&quot; https://example.com

          See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.

   --data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data  options
          with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

          To  be  CGI-compliant,  the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a name
          followed by a separator and a content specification. The  &lt;data&gt;
          part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

          content
                 This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                 on. Just be careful so that the content  doesn't  contain
                 any  =  or  @  symbols, as that will then make the syntax
                 match one of the other cases below!

          =content
                 This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                 on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

          name=content
                 This  will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass
                 that on. Note that the name part is expected to  be  URL-
                 encoded already.

          @filename
                 This  will  make  curl load data from the given file (in-
                 cluding any newlines), URL-encode that data and  pass  it
                 on in the POST.

          name@filename
                 This  will  make  curl load data from the given file (in-
                 cluding any newlines), URL-encode that data and  pass  it
                 on  in  the  POST.  The  name part gets an equal sign ap-
                 pended, resulting in  name=urlencoded-file-content.  Note
                 that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

   Examples:
    curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

   See also -d, --data and --data-raw. Added in 7.18.0.

   -d, --data &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP  MQTT)  Sends  the specified data in a POST request to the
          HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has
          filled  in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will
          cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

          --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
          pretation of the @ character. To post data  purely  binary,  you
          should  instead use the --data-binary option.  To URL-encode the
          value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

          If any of these options is used more than once on the same  com-
          mand  line,  the  data  pieces specified will be merged together
          with a separating  &amp;-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d
          skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like
          'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

          If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
          file  name  to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read
          the data from stdin. Posting data from  a  file  named  'foobar'
          would  thus  be done with -d, --data [@foobar](https://micro.blog/foobar). When -d, --data is
          told to read from a file like that, carriage  returns  and  new-
          lines will be stripped out. If you don't want the @ character to
          have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.

          Examples:
           curl -d &quot;name=curl&quot; https://example.com
           curl -d &quot;name=curl&quot; -d &quot;tool=cmdline&quot; https://example.com
           curl -d @filename https://example.com

          See also --data-binary, --data-urlencode  and  --data-raw.  This
          option  overrides  -F,  --form  and -I, --head and -T, --upload-
          file.

   --delegation &lt;LEVEL&gt;
          (GSS/kerberos) Set LEVEL to tell the server what it  is  allowed
          to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

          none   Don't allow any delegation.

          policy Delegates  if  and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set
                 in the Kerberos service ticket,  which  is  a  matter  of
                 realm policy.

          always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

   If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

   Example:
    curl --delegation &quot;none&quot; https://example.com

   --digest
          (HTTP)  Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authenti-
          cation scheme that prevents the password from  being  sent  over
          the  wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal
          -u, --user option to set user name and password.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.

          Example:
           curl -u name:password --digest https://example.com

          See  also  -u, --user, --proxy-digest and --anyauth. This option
          overrides --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.

   --disable-eprt
          (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
          when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
          attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with  this
          option,  it  will  use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten-
          sions to the original FTP protocol, and  may  not  work  on  all
          servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
          the traditional PORT command.

          --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
          is an alias for --disable-eprt.

          If  the  server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no
          effect as EPRT is necessary then.

          Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
          switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
          force it with --ftp-pasv.

          Example:
           curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/

   --disable-epsv
          (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when  do-
          ing  passive  FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first at-
          tempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
          try using EPSV.

          --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
          is an alias for --disable-epsv.

          If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have  no  effect
          as EPSV is necessary then.

          Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
          switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

          Example:
           curl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/

   -q, --disable
          If used as the first parameter on the command line,  the  curlrc
          config  file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config for
          details on the default config file search path.

          Example:
           curl -q https://example.com

   --disallow-username-in-url
          (HTTP) This tells curl to exit if  passed  a  url  containing  a
          username.  This  is  probably  most useful when the URL is being
          provided at run-time or similar.

          Example:
           curl --disallow-username-in-url https://example.com

          See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.

   --dns-interface &lt;interface&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  &lt;inter-
          face&gt;.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does
          not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name
          (not an address).

          Example:
           curl --dns-interface eth0 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-ipv4-addr  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-interface
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-ipv4-addr &lt;address&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt; when making IPv4 DNS re-
          quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
          The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-ipv6-addr &lt;address&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt; when making IPv6 DNS re-
          quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
          The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-ipv6-addr
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-servers &lt;addresses&gt;
          Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-
          fault.  The list of IP addresses should be separated  with  com-
          mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :&lt;port-number&gt;
          after each IP address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

          --dns-servers requires that the underlying libcurl was built  to
          support c-ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --doh-cert-status
          (all) Same as --cert-status but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

          Example:
           curl --doh-cert-status --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.76.0.

   --doh-insecure
          (all) Same as -k, --insecure but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

          Example:
           curl --doh-insecure --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.76.0.

   --doh-url &lt;URL&gt;
          (all)  Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to use to re-
          solve hostnames, instead of  using  the  default  name  resolver
          mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS.

          Some  SSL  options  that you set for your transfer will apply to
          DoH since the name lookups take place  over  SSL.  However,  the
          certificate  verification  settings are not inherited and can be
          controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.62.0.

   -D, --dump-header &lt;filename&gt;
          (HTTP FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the  specified
          file.  If  no  headers are received, the use of this option will
          create an empty file.

          When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines  are  considered
          being &quot;headers&quot; and thus are saved there.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dump-header store.txt https://example.com

          See also -o, --output.

   --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS)  Specify  the  path  name  to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
          socket. The socket is used to seed the  random  engine  for  SSL
          connections.

          Example:
           curl --egd-file /random/here https://example.com

          See also --random-file.

   --engine &lt;name&gt;
          (TLS)  Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher opera-
          tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported
          engines.  Note  that  not all (and possibly none) of the engines
          may be available at run-time.

          Example:
           curl --engine flavor https://example.com

   --etag-compare &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-
          cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-
          Match header using the stored ETag.

          For correct results, make sure that the specified file  contains
          only  a  single  line  with  the  desired ETag. An empty file is
          parsed as an empty ETag.

          Use the option --etag-save to first save the  ETag  from  a  re-
          sponse,  and  then  use this option to compare against the saved
          ETag in a subsequent request.

          Example:
           curl --etag-compare etag.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.68.0.

   --etag-save &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file.  An
          ETag  is  a  caching  related  header, usually returned in a re-
          sponse.

          If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

          Example:
           curl --etag-save storetag.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.68.0.

   --expect100-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
          (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
          100-continue  response  when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue
          header in its request. By default curl  will  wait  one  second.
          This  option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it
          will continue as if the response has been received.

          Example:
           curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com

          See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.

   --fail-early
          Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

          When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command  line,
          it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-
          fault, it will ignore errors if there are more  URLs  given  and
          the  last  URL's  success will determine the error code curl re-
          turns. So early failures will be &quot;hidden&quot; by subsequent success-
          ful transfers.

          Using  this  option,  curl  will  instead return an error on the
          first transfer that fails, independent of  the  amount  of  URLs
          that  are given on the command line. This way, no transfer fail-
          ures go undetected by scripts and similar.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to
          fail due to the server's HTTP status code. You can  combine  the
          two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-
          fore contained by -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example

          Added in 7.52.0.
   --fail-with-body
          (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP  response
          code  is  400  or  greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server
          fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating
          so  (which  often  also  describes why and more). This flag will
          still allow curl to output and save that content but also to re-
          turn error 22.

          This  is  an  alternative  option to -f, --fail which makes curl
          fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.

          Example:
           curl --fail-with-body https://example.com

          See also -f, --fail. Added in 7.76.0.

   -f, --fail
          (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server  errors.  This
          is  mostly done to enable scripts etc to better deal with failed
          attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
          document,  it  returns  an HTML document stating so (which often
          also describes why and more). This flag will prevent  curl  from
          outputting that and return error 22.

          This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
          successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-
          thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

          Example:
           curl --fail https://example.com

          See also --fail-with-body.

   --false-start
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use false start during the TLS handshake.
          False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending  ap-
          plication  data  before verifying the server's Finished message,
          thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

          This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure  Trans-
          port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

          Example:
           curl --false-start https://example.com

          Added in 7.42.0.

   --form-string &lt;name=string&gt;
          (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP)  Similar  to -F, --form except that the value
          string for the named parameter is used  literally.  Leading  '@'
          and '&lt;' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no
          special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's
          any  possibility  that the string value may accidentally trigger
          the '@' or '&lt;' features of -F, --form.

          Example:
           curl --form-string &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See also -F, --form.

   -F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;
          (HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets  curl  emu-
          late  a  filled-in  form  in which a user has pressed the submit
          button. This causes curl to POST  data  using  the  Content-Type
          multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.

          For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a mul-
          tipart mail message to transmit.

          This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force  the  'con-
          tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
          just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
          the  symbol  &lt;.  The  difference  between @ and &lt; is then that @
          makes a file get attached in the post as a  file  upload,  while
          the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
          field from a file.

          Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by  using
          - as filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. When stdin
          is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-
          termine its size and allow a possible resend.  Defining a part's
          data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-
          ilar)  is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be ef-
          fectively read at transmission time; since the full size is  un-
          known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by
          HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

          Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the
          name  of  the  form-field to which the file portrait.jpg will be
          the input:

           curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

          Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to  the
          server:

           curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

          Example:  send your essay in a text field to the server. Send it
          as a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a  local
          file:

           curl -F &quot;story=&lt;hugefile.txt&quot; https://example.com/

          You  can  also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use by using
          'type=', in a manner similar to:

           curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot; example.com

          or

           curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot; example.com

          You can also explicitly change the name field of a  file  upload
          part by setting filename=, like this:

           curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot; example.com

          If  filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by dou-
          ble-quotes like:

           curl -F &quot;file=@\&quot;local,file\&quot;;filename=\&quot;name;in;post\&quot;&quot;  exam-
          ple.com

          or

           curl   -F   'file=@&quot;local,file&quot;;filename=&quot;name;in;post&quot;'  exam-
          ple.com

          Note that if a filename/path is  quoted  by  double-quotes,  any
          double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
          backslash.

          Quoting must also be applied to non-file  data  if  it  contains
          semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:

           curl  -F  'colors=&quot;red;  green;  blue&quot;;type=text/x-myapp' exam-
          ple.com

          You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,
          like

            curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=\&quot;X-submit-type: OK\&quot;&quot; example.com

          or

            curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=@headerfile&quot; example.com

          The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes
          about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty
          lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each
          header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting
          the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns
          and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a
          header file contents:

            # This file contain two headers.
            X-header-1: this is a header

            # The following header is folded.
            X-header-2: this is
             another header

          To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-
          tended as follows:
          - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of
          the argument,
          -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-
          part: it can be followed by a content type specification.
          - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.

          Example: the following command sends an SMTP  mime  e-mail  con-
          sisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text
          and HTML. It attaches a text file:

           curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
                   -F '=plain text message' \
                   -F '= &lt;body&gt;HTML message&lt;/body&gt;;type=text/html' \
                -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com

          Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.  Available  en-
          codings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding the
          corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit  that  only
          rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error, quoted-printable
          and base64 that encodes  data  according  to  the  corresponding
          schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

          Example:  send  multipart mail with a quoted-printable text mes-
          sage and a base64 attached file:

           curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
                -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com

          See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          Example:
           curl --form &quot;name=curl&quot; --form &quot;file=@loadthis&quot; https://example.com

          This option overrides -d, --data and -I, --head  and  -T,  --up-
          load-file.

   --ftp-account &lt;data&gt;
          (FTP) When an FTP server asks for &quot;account data&quot; after user name
          and password has been provided, this data is sent off using  the
          ACCT command.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-account &quot;mr.robot&quot; ftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.13.0.

   --ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;
          (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
          send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
          Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
          &quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
          the certificate.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-alternative-to-user &quot;U53r&quot; ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.15.5.

   --ftp-create-dirs
          (FTP  SFTP)  When  an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that
          doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior  of
          curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
          create missing directories.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

          See also --create-dirs.

   --ftp-method &lt;method&gt;
          (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
          FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
          ing alternatives:

          multicwd
                 curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in
                 the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many
                 commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it  should  be  done.
                 This is the default but the slowest behavior.

          nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                 etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                 mands. This is the fastest behavior.

          singlecwd
                 curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                 operates on the file &quot;normally&quot;  (like  in  the  multicwd
                 case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than
                 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

   Examples:
    curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
    curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
    curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

   Added in 7.15.1.

   --ftp-pasv
          (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive  is  the
          internal  default behavior, but using this option can be used to
          override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.  Undoing  an  enforced passive really isn't doable but you
          must then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.

          Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
          then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/

          See also --disable-epsv. Added in 7.11.0.

   -P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
          (FTP)  Reverses  the  default initiator/listener roles when con-
          necting with FTP. This option makes curl use active  mode.  curl
          then  tells the server to connect back to the client's specified
          address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
          IP  address  and  port for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be
          one of:

          interface
                 e.g. &quot;eth0&quot; to specify which interface's IP  address  you
                 want to use (Unix only)

          IP address
                 e.g. &quot;192.168.10.1&quot; to specify the exact IP address

          host name
                 e.g. &quot;my.host.domain&quot; to specify the machine

          -      make  curl  pick the same IP address that is already used
                 for the control connection

   If this option is used several times, the last one will be  used.  Dis-
   able  the  use  of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
   EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
   PORT++.

   Since  7.19.5,  you can append &quot;:[start]-[end]&quot; to the right of the ad-
   dress, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you  specify
   a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as
   well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the  port
   may not be available.

   Examples:
    curl -P - ftp:/example.com
    curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com
    curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

   See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.

   --ftp-pret
          (FTP)  Tell  curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV).
          Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd,  require  this  non-standard
          command  for  directory  listings as well as up and downloads in
          PASV mode.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
          (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
          its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data
          connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-
          ready uses for the control connection.

          Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

          This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
          of PASV.
          Example:
           curl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/

          See also --ftp-pasv. Added in 7.14.2.

   --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode &lt;active/passive&gt;
          (FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate  the
          shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
          reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
          the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

          See also --ftp-ssl-ccc. Added in 7.16.2.

   --ftp-ssl-ccc
          (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
          layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
          munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
          low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

          See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode. Added in 7.16.1.

   --ftp-ssl-control
          (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP  login,  clear  for  transfer.
          Allows  secure  authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers
          for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server  doesn't  sup-
          port SSL/TLS.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.16.0.

   -G, --get
          When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,
          --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP
          GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
          used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.
          If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-
          stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

          If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
          used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but  you
          should then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.

          Examples:
           curl --get https://example.com
           curl --get -d &quot;tool=curl&quot; -d &quot;age=old&quot; https://example.com
           curl --get -I -d &quot;tool=curl&quot; https://example.com

   -g, --globoff
          This option switches off the &quot;URL globbing parser&quot;. When you set
          this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters  {}[]
          without  having curl itself interpret them. Note that these let-
          ters are not normal legal URL contents but they  should  be  en-
          coded according to the URI standard.

          Example:
           curl -g &quot;https://example.com/{[]}}}}&quot;

   --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms &lt;milliseconds&gt;
          Happy  Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both
          IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for  dual-stack  hosts,  giving  IPv6  a
          head-start  of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6
          address cannot be connected to within that time, then a  connec-
          tion  attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first
          connection to be established is the one that is used.

          The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs
          RFC  6555  says  &quot;It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be
          paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network
          load.&quot;  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
          currently default to 300 ms.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500 https://example.com

          Added in 7.59.0.

   --haproxy-protocol
          (HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the  beginning
          of  the  connection. This is used by some load balancers and re-
          verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.
          This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to  a
          service that expects this header.

          Example:
           curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

          Added in 7.60.0.

   -I, --head
          (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
          command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
          document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the
          file size and last modification time only.

          Example:
           curl -I https://example.com
   -H, --header &lt;header/@file&gt;
          (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
          to  a  server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note
          that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as
          one  of  the  internal  ones curl would use, your externally set
          header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you
          to  make  even  trickier  stuff than curl would normally do. You
          should not replace internally set headers without  knowing  per-
          fectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giv-
          ing a replacement without content  on  the  right  side  of  the
          colon, as in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;. If you send the custom header with no-
          value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon,  such
          as -H &quot;X-Custom-Header;&quot; to send &quot;X-Custom-Header:&quot;.

          curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
          with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
          as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
          returns, they will only mess things up for you.

          This option can take an argument in @filename style, which  then
          adds  a  header  for  each line in the input file. Using @- will
          make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

          You need --proxy-header to send custom headers  intended  for  a
          HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

          Passing  on  a  &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; header when doing a
          HTTP request with a request body, will make curl send  the  data
          using chunked encoding.

          WARNING:  headers  set  with  this option will be set in all re-
          quests - even after redirects are followed, like when told  with
          -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to other
          hosts than the original host, so  sensitive  headers  should  be
          used with caution combined with following redirects.

          This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
          multiple headers.

          Examples:
           curl -H &quot;X-First-Name: Joe&quot; https://example.com
           curl -H &quot;User-Agent: yes-please/2000&quot; https://example.com
           curl -H &quot;Host:&quot; https://example.com

          See also -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer.

   -h, --help &lt;category&gt;
          Usage help. This lists all commands of the  &lt;category&gt;.   If  no
          arg  was  provided, curl will display the most important command
          line arguments.  If the argument &quot;all&quot; was provided,  curl  will
          display  all  options available.  If the argument &quot;category&quot; was
          provided, curl will display all categories and their meanings.

          Example:
           curl --help all

   --hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt;
          (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal  digits.  The
          string  should  be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's
          public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
          the md5sums match.

          Example:
           curl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.17.1.

   --hsts &lt;file name&gt;
          (HTTPS)  This  option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the file
          name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that will  be  used.
          After  a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file
          name again if it has been modified.

          Specify a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
          make curl just handle HSTS in memory.

          If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
          from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

          Example:
           curl --hsts cache.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.74.0.

   --http0.9
          (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

          HTTP/0.9 is a completely headerless response and  therefore  you
          can  also  connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still get a
          response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if al-
          lowed.

          Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

          Example:
           curl --http0.9 https://example.com

   -0, --http1.0
          (HTTP)  Tells  curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its
          internally preferred HTTP version.

          Example:
           curl --http1.0 https://example.com

          This option overrides --http1.1 and --http2.

   --http1.1
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

          Example:
           curl --http1.1 https://example.com

          This option  overrides  -0,  --http1.0  and  --http2.  Added  in
          7.33.0.

   --http2-prior-knowledge
          (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to  issue  its  non-TLS HTTP requests using
          HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade.  It  requires  prior  knowledge
          that  the  server  supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests
          will still do HTTP/2 the standard way with  negotiated  protocol
          version in the TLS handshake.

          Example:
           curl --http2-prior-knowledge https://example.com

          --http2-prior-knowledge requires that the underlying libcurl was
          built to support HTTP/2. This option overrides --http1.1 and -0,
          --http1.0 and --http2. Added in 7.49.0.

   --http2
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

          For  HTTPS,  this means curl will attempt to negotiate HTTP/2 in
          the TLS handshake. curl does this by default.

          For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to
          HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.

          Example:
           curl --http2 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http3. --http2 requires that the under-
          lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This option overrides
          --http1.1  and  -0, --http1.0 and --http2-prior-knowledge. Added
          in 7.33.0.

   --http3
          (HTTP) WARNING: this option is experimental. Do not use in  pro-
          duction.

          Tells  curl  to use HTTP version 3 directly to the host and port
          number used in the URL. A normal HTTP/3 transaction will be done
          to  a  host and then get redirected via Alt-Svc, but this option
          allows a user to circumvent that when you know that  the  target
          speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

          This  option  will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be
          established, it cannot fall back to a lower HTTP version on  its
          own.

          Example:
           curl --http3 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http2. --http3 requires that the under-
          lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option overrides
          --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowl-
          edge. Added in 7.66.0.

   --ignore-content-length
          (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is
          particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will
          report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-
          bytes.

          For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the
          size before downloading a file.

          This option doesn't work for HTTP if libcurl was  built  to  use
          hyper.

          Example:
           curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

   -i, --include
          Include  the  HTTP  response headers in the output. The HTTP re-
          sponse headers can include things  like  server  name,  cookies,
          date of the document, HTTP version and more...

          To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.

          Example:
           curl -i https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose.

   -k, --insecure
          (TLS) By default, every SSL connection curl makes is verified to
          be secure. This option allows curl to proceed and  operate  even
          for server connections otherwise considered insecure.

          The  server  connection  is verified by making sure the server's
          certificate contains the right name  and  verifies  successfully
          using the cert store.

          See this online resource for further details:
           https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

          WARNING: this makes the transfer insecure.

          Example:
           curl --insecure https://example.com

          See also --proxy-insecure and --cacert.

   --interface &lt;name&gt;

          Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter
          interface name, IP address or host name. An example  could  look
          like:

           curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          On  Linux  it can be used to specify a VRF, but the binary needs
          to either have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root.  More  informa-
          tion   about  Linux  VRF:  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documenta-
          tion/networking/vrf.txt

          Example:
           curl --interface eth0 https://example.com

          See also --dns-interface.

   -4, --ipv4
          This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses  only,
          and not for example try IPv6.

          Example:
           curl --ipv4 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and  --http2.  This  option  overrides -6,
          --ipv6.

   -6, --ipv6
          This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses  only,
          and not for example try IPv4.

          Example:
           curl --ipv6 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and  --http2.  This  option  overrides -4,
          --ipv4.

   -j, --junk-session-cookies
          (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
          option will make it discard all &quot;session cookies&quot;. This will ba-
          sically have the same effect as if a  new  session  is  started.
          Typical  browsers  always  discard  session cookies when they're
          closed down.

          Example:
           curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com

          See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.

   --keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle  be-
          fore  sending  keepalive  probes and the time between individual
          keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
          offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
          (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has  no
          effect if --no-keepalive is used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

          Example:
           curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --key-type &lt;type&gt;
          (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key  pro-
          vided  private  key  is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not
          specified, PEM is assumed.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com

   --key &lt;key&gt;
          (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
          vate  key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified, curl
          tries  the  following  candidates  in  order:   '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
          '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

          If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
          is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
          ify  a  private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
          ning with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
          PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
          &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the --key-type option will  be
          set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com

   --krb &lt;level&gt;
          (FTP)  Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be
          entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
          'private'.  Should  you  use  a  level that is not one of these,
          'private' will instead be used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/

          --krb requires that the underlying libcurl was built to  support
          Kerberos.

   --libcurl &lt;file&gt;
          Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
          will get libcurl-using C source code written to  the  file  that
          does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last given  file  name
          will be used.

          Example:
           curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.1.

   --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
          Specify  the  maximum  transfer  rate you want curl to use - for
          both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a
          limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire
          bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

          The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is
          appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-
          bytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes  it
          gigabytes.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For ex-
          ample 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

          If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that  option  will
          take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
          help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
           curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
           curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

   -l, --list-only
          (FTP POP3) (FTP) When listing  an  FTP  directory,  this  switch
          forces  a  name-only view. This is especially useful if the user
          wants to machine-parse the contents of an  FTP  directory  since
          the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format.
          When used like this, the option causes an  NLST  command  to  be
          sent to the server instead of LIST.

          Note:  Some  FTP  servers  list  only files in their response to
          NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

          (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3,  this  switch
          forces  a  LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is
          particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific  mes-
          sage-id exists on the server and what size it is.

          Note:  When combined with -X, --request, this option can be used
          to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the  email's
          unique  identifier  rather  than  its message-id to make the re-
          quest.

          Example:
           curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/

          Added in 4.0.

   --local-port &lt;num/range&gt;
          Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of  local  port
          numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
          nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so  set-
          ting  this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary
          connection setup failures.

          Example:
           curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.15.2.

   --location-trusted
          (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending  the  name  +
          password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
          may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
          a  site  to which you'll send your authentication info (which is
          plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

          Example:
           curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com

          See also -u, --user.

   -L, --location
          (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page  has  moved
          to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
          3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the  request
          on  the  new  place.  If used together with -i, --include or -I,
          --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-
          thentication  is  used,  curl  only sends its credentials to the
          initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different  host,  it
          won't  be  able to intercept the user+password. See also --loca-
          tion-trusted on how to change this. You can limit the amount  of
          redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

          When  curl  follows  a redirect and if the request is a POST, it
          will send the following request with a GET if the HTTP  response
          was  301,  302,  or  303. If the response code was any other 3xx
          code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-
          modified method.

          You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
          response by using the dedicated  options  for  that:  --post301,
          --post302 and --post303.

          The  method  set  with  -X,  --request overrides the method curl
          would otherwise select to use.

          Example:
           curl -L https://example.com

   --login-options &lt;options&gt;
          (IMAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use during  server
          authentication.

          You  can  use login options to specify protocol specific options
          that may be used during authentication. At  present  only  IMAP,
          POP3  and SMTP support login options. For more information about
          login options please see RFC  2384,  RFC  5092  and  IETF  draft
          draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --mail-auth &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP)  Specify  a  single address. This will be used to specify
          the authentication address (identity)  of  a  submitted  message
          that is being relayed to another server.

          Example:
           curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/

          See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from. Added in 7.25.0.

   --mail-from &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP)  Specify  a single address that the given mail should get
          sent from.

          Example:
           curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/

          See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth. Added in 7.20.0.

   --mail-rcpt-allowfails
          (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl
          will  abort  SMTP conversation if at least one of the recipients
          causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

          The default behavior can be changed by  passing  --mail-rcpt-al-
          lowfails  command-line option which will make curl ignore errors
          and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

          If all recipients trigger RCPT TO  failures  and  this  flag  is
          specified,  curl  will still abort the SMTP conversation and re-
          turn the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

          Example:
           curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

          Added in 7.69.0.

   --mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP) Specify a single e-mail address,  user  name  or  mailing
          list  name. Repeat this option several times to send to multiple
          recipients.

          When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the  re-
          cipient  should  be  specified as the user name or user name and
          domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

          When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
          ient  should  be  specified using the mailing list name, such as
          &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;London-Office&quot;.  (Added in 7.34.0)

          Example:
           curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

          Added in 7.20.0.

   -M, --manual
          Manual. Display the huge help text.

          Example:
           curl --manual

   --max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
          (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
          download.  If  the file requested is larger than this value, the
          transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

          A size modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k'  or  'K'
          will  count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes it
          megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples:  200K,
          3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)

          NOTE:  The  file size is not always known prior to download, and
          for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
          fer ends up being larger than this given limit.  Example:
           curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com

          See also --limit-rate.

   --max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
          (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number of redirections to follow. When -L,
          --location is used, to prevent  curl  from  following  too  many
          redirects,  by  default,  the  limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
          this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com

   -m, --max-time &lt;fractional seconds&gt;
          Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to
          take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
          ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down.   Since
          7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual time-
          out will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases
          in decimal precision.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --max-time 10 https://example.com
           curl --max-time 2.92 https://example.com

          See also --connect-timeout.

   --metalink
          This  option was previously used to specify a metalink resource.
          Metalink support has been disabled in curl since 7.78.0 for  se-
          curity reasons.

          Example:
           curl --metalink file https://example.com

          Added in 7.27.0.

   --negotiate
          (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

          This  option  requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI sup-
          port. Use -V, --version  to  see  if  your  curl  supports  GSS-
          API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

          When  using this option, you must also provide a fake -u, --user
          option to activate the authentication code properly.  Sending  a
          '-u  :'  is  enough  as  the user name and password from the -u,
          --user option aren't actually used.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.

          Example:
           curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com

          See also --basic, --ntlm, --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.

   --netrc-file &lt;filename&gt;
          This  option  is similar to -n, --netrc, except that you provide
          the path (absolute or relative) to  the  netrc  file  that  curl
          should use.  You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.
          If several --netrc-file options are provided, the last one  will
          be used.

          It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

          Example:
           curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com

          This option overrides -n, --netrc. Added in 7.21.5.

   --netrc-optional
          Very  similar  to  -n, --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc
          usage optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.

          Example:
           curl --netrc-optional https://example.com

          See also --netrc-file. This option overrides -n, --netrc.

   -n, --netrc
          Makes curl scan the .netrc  (_netrc  on  Windows)  file  in  the
          user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
          cally used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will  enable
          user  authentication. See netrc(5) and ftp(1) for details on the
          file format. Curl will not complain if that  file  doesn't  have
          the  right  permissions  (it should be neither world- nor group-
          readable). The environment variable &quot;HOME&quot; is used to  find  the
          home directory.

          A  quick and very simple example of how to setup a .netrc to al-
          low curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com  with  user  name
          'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:

          machine host.domain.com login myself password secret

          Example:
           curl --netrc https://example.com

   -:, --next
          Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
          associated options. This allows you  to  send  several  URL  re-
          quests,  each with their own specific options, for example, such
          as different user names or custom requests for each.

          -:, --next will reset all local options  and  only  global  ones
          will  have  their values survive over to the operation following
          the -:, --next instruction. Global options  include  -v,  --ver-
          bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.

          For  example,  you can do both a GET and a POST in a single com-
          mand line:

           curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

          Examples:
           curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
           curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

          Added in 7.36.0.

   --no-alpn
          (HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled  by  de-
          fault  if  libcurl  was  built with an SSL library that supports
          ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to  negoti-
          ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

          Example:
           curl --no-alpn https://example.com

          See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-
          derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

   -N, --no-buffer
          Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
          uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
          will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
          necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
          will disable that buffering.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.

          Example:
           curl --no-buffer https://example.com

   --no-keepalive
          Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.
          curl otherwise enables them by default.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

          Example:
           curl --no-keepalive https://example.com

   --no-npn
          (HTTPS) Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default
          if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN.  NPN
          is  used  by  a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2
          support with the server during https sessions.

          Example:
           curl --no-npn https://example.com

          See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-
          derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

   --no-progress-meter
          Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or
          otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,
          --silent does.

          Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
          thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.

          Example:
           curl --no-progress-meter -o store https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.

   --no-sessionid
          (TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By  default
          all  transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing
          should ever get hurt by attempting  to  reuse  SSL  session-IDs,
          there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
          require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

          Example:
           curl --no-sessionid https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.0.

   --noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
          Comma-separated  list  of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if
          one is specified. The only wildcard is  a  single  *  character,
          which  matches  all  hosts,  and effectively disables the proxy.
          Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which  con-
          tains  the  hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, lo-
          cal.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and  www.local.com,
          but not www.notlocal.com.

          Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
          that disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY').  If  there's
          an  environment  variable disabling a proxy, you can set the no-
          proxy list to &quot;&quot; to override it.

          Example:
           curl --noproxy &quot;www.example&quot; https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --ntlm-wb
          (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over
          the  authentication  to the separate binary ntlmauth application
          that is executed when needed.

          Example:
           curl --ntlm-wb -u user:password https://example.com

          See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.

   --ntlm (HTTP) Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM  authentication
          method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
          It is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever  peo-
          ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
          behavior should not be endorsed, you should  encourage  everyone
          who  uses  NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentica-
          tion method instead, such as Digest.

          If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy  authentication,  then
          use --proxy-ntlm.

          If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
          used.

          Example:
           curl --ntlm -u user:password https://example.com

          See also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the  underlying
          libcurl  was built to support TLS. This option overrides --basic
          and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.

   --oauth2-bearer &lt;token&gt;
          (IMAP POP3 SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer  Token  for  OAUTH  2.0
          server  authentication.  The Bearer Token is used in conjunction
          with the user name which can be specified as part of  the  --url
          or -u, --user options.

          The  Bearer  Token  and user name are formatted according to RFC
          6750.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --oauth2-bearer &quot;mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM&quot; https://example.com

   --output-dir &lt;dir&gt;

          This option specifies the directory in  which  files  should  be
          stored, when -O, --remote-name or -o, --output are used.

          The  given  output directory is used for all URLs and output op-
          tions on the command line, up until the first -:, --next.

          If the specified target directory doesn't exist,  the  operation
          will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.

          If this option is used multiple times, the last specified direc-
          tory will be used.

          Example:
           curl --output-dir &quot;tmp&quot; -O https://example.com

          See also -O, --remote-name and -J,  --remote-header-name.  Added
          in 7.73.0.

   -o, --output &lt;file&gt;
          Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
          [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you
          can  use  '#' followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That
          variable will be replaced with the current string  for  the  URL
          being fetched. Like in:

           curl &quot;http://{one,two}.example.com&quot; -o &quot;file_#1.txt&quot;

          or use several variables like:

           curl &quot;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com&quot; -o &quot;#1_#2&quot;

          You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
          have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
          line, you can use it like this:

            curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

          and  the  order  of  the -o options and the URLs doesn't matter,
          just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
          above command line can also be written as

            curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

          See  also  the --create-dirs option to create the local directo-
          ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
          will force the output to be done to stdout.

          To   suppress  response  bodies,  you  can  redirect  output  to
          /dev/null:

            curl example.com -o /dev/null

          Or for Windows use nul:
            curl example.com -o nul

          Examples:
           curl -o file https://example.com
           curl &quot;http://{one,two}.example.com&quot; -o &quot;file_#1.txt&quot;
           curl &quot;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com&quot; -o &quot;#1_#2&quot;
           curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net

          See also -O, --remote-name, --remote-name-all and -J,  --remote-
          header-name.

   --parallel-immediate
          When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl
          that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-
          allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be
          added as multiplexed streams on another connection.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --parallel-immediate -Z https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

          See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.

   --parallel-max &lt;num&gt;
          When  asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel, this
          option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-
          ously.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.
          The default is 50.

          Example:
           curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

          See also -Z, --parallel. Added in 7.66.0.

   -Z, --parallel
          Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to  the
          regular serial manner.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

          Added in 7.66.0.

   --pass &lt;phrase&gt;
          (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --pass secret --key file https://example.com

   --path-as-is
          Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./  in  the  given
          URL  path.  Normally curl will squash or merge them according to
          standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

          Example:
           curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

          Added in 7.42.0.

   --pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  public  key  file  (or
          hashes)  to  verify the peer. This can be a path to a file which
          contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
          of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
          rated by ';'

          When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection,  the  server  sends  a
          certificate  indicating  its identity. A public key is extracted
          from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the  pub-
          lic  key provided to this option, curl will abort the connection
          before sending or receiving any data.

          PEM/DER support:

          7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

          7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

          7.47.0: mbedtls
          sha256 support:

          7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

          7.47.0: mbedtls

          Other SSL backends not supported.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
           curl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

   --post301
          (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
          requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
          non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
          conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
          may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
          This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post301 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post302,  --post303  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.17.1.

   --post302
          (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
          requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
          non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
          conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
          may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
          This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post302 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post301,  --post303  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.19.1.

   --post303
          (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
          requests  into  GET  requests when following 303 redirections. A
          server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirect-
          ion. This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post303 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post302,  --post301  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.26.0.

   --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
          Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to  an  HTTP  or
          HTTPS  -x,  --proxy.  In  such a case curl first connects to the
          SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS)  to  the  HTTP  or
          HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

          The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
          fix to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use  socks4://,
          socks4a://,  socks5://  or  socks5h://  to  request the specific
          SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified will  make  curl
          default to SOCKS4.

          If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
          assumed to be 1080.

          User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
          URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-
          ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -#, --progress-bar
          Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-
          stead of the standard, more informational, meter.

          This  progress  bar draws a single line of '#' characters across
          the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
          For  transfers  without  a  known size, there will be space ship
          (-=o=-) that moves back and forth but only while data  is  being
          transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl -# -O https://example.com

   --proto-default &lt;protocol&gt;
          Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.

          An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-
          PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).

          This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

          Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host
          name, see --url for details.

          Example:
           curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com

          Added in 7.45.0.

   --proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;
          Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect.  Pro-
          tocols  denied by --proto are not overridden by this option. See
          --proto for how protocols are represented.

          Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

           curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

          By default curl will allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on redirect
          (7.65.2).  Older versions of curl allowed all protocols on redi-
          rect except several disabled for security reasons: Since  7.19.4
          FILE  and  SCP  are  disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS are
          also disabled. Specifying all or +all enables all  protocols  on
          redirect, including those disabled for security.

          Example:
           curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com

          Added in 7.20.2.

   --proto &lt;protocols&gt;
          Tells  curl  to  limit  what protocols it may use for transfers.
          Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated,  and
          are  each  a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero
          or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

          +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
             ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

          -  Deny  this  protocol,  removing it from the list of protocols
             already permitted.

          =  Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already  permit-
             ted),  though subject to later modification by subsequent en-
             tries in the comma separated list.

          For example:

          --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

          --proto -all,https,+http
                         only enables http and https

          --proto =http,https
                         also only enables http and https

          Unknown protocols produce a  warning.  This  allows  scripts  to
          safely  rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous pro-
          tocols, without relying upon support  for  that  protocol  being
          built into curl to avoid an error.

          This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect
          is the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance  of
          the option.

          Example:
           curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

          See also --proto-redir and --proto-default. Added in 7.20.2.

   --proxy-anyauth
          Tells  curl to pick a suitable authentication method when commu-
          nicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might  cause  an  extra
          request/response round-trip.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest. Added in
          7.13.2.

   --proxy-basic
          Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication  when  communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
          remote host. Basic is the  default  authentication  method  curl
          uses with proxies.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.

   --proxy-cacert &lt;file&gt;
          Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

          See  also  --proxy-capath,  --cacert,  --capath and -x, --proxy.
          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-capath &lt;dir&gt;
          Same as --capath but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-cacert, -x,  --proxy  and  --capath.  Added  in
          7.52.0.

   --proxy-cert-type &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --cert-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-cert &lt;cert[:passwd]&gt;
          Same as -E, --cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-ciphers &lt;list&gt;
          Same as --ciphers but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-crlfile &lt;file&gt;
          Same as --crlfile but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-crlfile rejects.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-digest
          Tells  curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
          a remote host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

   --proxy-header &lt;header/@file&gt;
          (HTTP)  Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP
          to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
          the  equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy communi-
          cation only like in CONNECT requests when you  want  a  separate
          header  sent  to  the proxy to what is sent to the actual remote
          host.

          curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
          with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
          as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
          returns, they will only mess things up for you.

          Headers  specified  with this option will not be included in re-
          quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

          Starting in 7.55.0, this option can take an argument  in  @file-
          name  style, which then adds a header for each line in the input
          file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.

          This option can be used  multiple  times  to  add/replace/remove
          multiple headers.

          Examples:
           curl --proxy-header &quot;X-First-Name: Joe&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com
           curl --proxy-header &quot;User-Agent: surprise&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com
           curl --proxy-header &quot;Host:&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.37.0.
   --proxy-insecure
          Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-insecure -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-key-type &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-key-type DER --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-key &lt;key&gt;
          Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

   --proxy-negotiate
          Tells  curl  to  use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when
          communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling
          HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-negotiate --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic. Added in 7.17.1.

   --proxy-ntlm
          Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
          host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy-user user:passwd -x http://proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-negotiate and --proxy-anyauth.

   --proxy-pass &lt;phrase&gt;
          Same as --pass but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-pass secret --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
          hashes) to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file  which
          contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
          of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
          rated by ';'

          When  negotiating  a  TLS  or SSL connection, the server sends a
          certificate indicating its identity. A public key  is  extracted
          from  this certificate and if it does not exactly match the pub-
          lic key provided to this option, curl will abort the  connection
          before sending or receiving any data.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
           curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

   --proxy-service-name &lt;name&gt;
          This  option allows you to change the service name for proxy ne-
          gotiation.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-service-name &quot;shrubbery&quot; -x proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.43.0.

   --proxy-ssl-allow-beast
          Same as --ssl-allow-beast but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ssl-allow-beast -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert
          Same as --ssl-auto-client-cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.77.0.

   --proxy-tls13-ciphers &lt;ciphersuite list&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection  to
          your HTTPS proxy when it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers
          suites must specify valid ciphers. Read up  on  TLS  1.3  cipher
          suite details on this URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          This  option  is  currently  used only when curl is built to use
          OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
          you  can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --proxy-
          ciphers option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com

   --proxy-tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --tlsauthtype but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlspassword &lt;string&gt;
          Same as --tlspassword but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
          Same as --tlsuser but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlsv1
          Same as -1, --tlsv1 but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -U, --proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify the user name and password to use for proxy  authentica-
          tion.

          If  you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either Ne-
          gotiate or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to  select
          the user name and password from your environment by specifying a
          single colon with this option: &quot;-U :&quot;.

          On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
          ment  from  process listings. This is not enough to protect cre-
          dentials from possibly getting seen by other users on  the  same
          system  as  they will still be visible for a brief moment before
          cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
          stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com

   -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
          Use the specified proxy.

          The  proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No
          protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
          socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
          cific SOCKS version to be used.  (The protocol support was added
          in curl 7.21.7)

          HTTPS  proxy  support  via https:// protocol prefix was added in
          7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

          Unrecognized and unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause  an  error
          since  7.52.0.   Prior  versions may ignore the protocol and use
          http:// instead.

          If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is
          assumed to be 1080.

          This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
          the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
          proxy, you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to override it.

          All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-
          parently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain  protocol
          specific operations might not be available. This is not the case
          if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-
          ytunnel option.

          User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
          URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-
          ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

          The  proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the proxy
          environment variables, including the protocol  prefix  (http://)
          and the embedded user + password.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

   --proxy1.0 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
          specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

          The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  -x,
          --proxy,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
          specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

          Example:
           curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com

   -p, --proxytunnel
          When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this  option  will  make
          curl  tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with
          the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the  proxy  al-
          lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-
          nel through to.

          To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is  set  to
          output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.

          Example:
           curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy.

   --pubkey &lt;key&gt;
          (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
          lic key in this separate file.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
          key  from the private key file, so passing this option is gener-
          ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
          libcurl  to  be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher
          that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

          Example:
           curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

   -Q, --quote &lt;command&gt;
          (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
          server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
          (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
          exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
          prefix them with a dash '-'.  To make  commands  be  sent  after
          curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer
          command(s), prefix the command with a '+'  (this  is  only  sup-
          ported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.

          By  default  curl  will stop at first failure. To make curl con-
          tinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with an  as-
          terisk  (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of
          the commands, the entire operation will be aborted.

          You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959  de-
          fines  to  FTP  servers,  or one of the commands listed below to
          SFTP servers.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets  SFTP
          quote  commands  itself before sending them to the server.  File
          names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-
          acters.   Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote com-
          mands:

          atime date file
                 The atime command sets the last access time of  the  file
                 named  by  the file operand. The &lt;date expression&gt; can be
                 all sorts of date strings, see  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
                 page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

          chgrp group file
                 The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                 the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                 operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

          chmod mode file
                 The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                 specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                 number.

          chown user file
                 The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                 file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                 and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

          ln source_file target_file
                 The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                 target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                 tion.

          mkdir directory_name
                 The  mkdir command creates the directory named by the di-
                 rectory_name operand.

          mtime date file
                 The mtime command sets the last modification time of  the
                 file named by the file operand. The &lt;date expression&gt; can
                 be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man
                 page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

          pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                 rent working directory.

          rename source target
                 The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                 the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                 target operand.

          rm file
                 The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                 erand.

          rmdir directory
                 The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                 by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

          symlink source_file target_file
                 See ln.

   Example:
    curl --quote &quot;DELE file&quot; ftp://example.com/foo

   --random-file &lt;file&gt;
          Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
          as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
          for SSL connections.  See also the --egd-file option.

          Example:
           curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com

   -r, --range &lt;range&gt;
          (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial docu-
          ment)  from  an  HTTP/1.1,  FTP  or SFTP server or a local FILE.
          Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

          0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

          500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

          -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

          9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

          0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

          100-199,500-599
                    specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

          (*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a  mul-
          tipart  response,  which will be returned as-is by curl! Parsing
          or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of
          the caller.

          Only  digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and 'stop'
          fields of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit  charac-
          ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
          ified, depending on the server's configuration.

          You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not  have
          this  feature  enabled, so that when you attempt to get a range,
          you'll instead get the whole document.

          FTP and SFTP range downloads only  support  the  simple  'start-
          stop'  syntax  (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP
          use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --range 22-44 https://example.com

   --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
          tent  or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on un-
          altered, raw.

          Example:
           curl --raw https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.2.

   -e, --referer &lt;URL&gt;
          (HTTP) Sends the &quot;Referrer Page&quot; information to the HTTP server.
          This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
          used with -L, --location you  can  append  &quot;;auto&quot;  to  the  -e,
          --referer  URL  to  make curl automatically set the previous URL
          when it follows a Location: header. The &quot;;auto&quot;  string  can  be
          used alone, even if you don't set an initial -e, --referer.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --referer &quot;https://fake.example&quot; https://example.com
           curl --referer &quot;https://fake.example;auto&quot; -L https://example.com
           curl --referer &quot;;auto&quot; -L https://example.com

          See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.

   -J, --remote-header-name
          (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the
          server-specified Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of  ex-
          tracting a filename from the URL.

          If  the  server  specifies a file name and a file with that name
          already exists in the current working directory it will  not  be
          overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't spec-
          ify a file name then this option has no effect.

          There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in  the  provided
          file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
          file names.

          WARNING: Exercise judicious use of this  option,  especially  on
          Windows.  A  rogue  server  could  send you the name of a DLL or
          other file that could possibly be loaded automatically  by  Win-
          dows or some third party software.

          Example:
           curl -OJ https://example.com/file

   --remote-name-all
          This  option changes the default action for all given URLs to be
          dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if
          you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
          all has been used, you must use &quot;-o -&quot; or --no-remote-name.

          Example:
           curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

          Added in 7.19.0.

   -O, --remote-name
          Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
          (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
          off.)

          The file will be saved in the current working directory. If  you
          want  the  file  saved  in  a different directory, make sure you
          change the current working directory before invoking  curl  with
          this option.

          The  remote  file  name  to use for saving is extracted from the
          given URL, nothing else, and if it already  exists  it  will  be
          overwritten.  If  you  want  the server to be able to choose the
          file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
          addition  to  this option. If the server chooses a file name and
          that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

          There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
          other  URL  encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as
          file name.

          You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you
          have.

          Example:
           curl -O https://example.com/filename

   -R, --remote-time
          When  used,  this will make curl attempt to figure out the time-
          stamp of the remote file, and if that is available make the  lo-
          cal file get that same timestamp.

          Example:
           curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com

   --request-target &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP)  Tells curl to use an alternative &quot;target&quot; (path) instead
          of using the path as provided in the  URL.  Particularly  useful
          when  wanting  to  issue  HTTP requests without leading slash or
          other data that doesn't follow the  regular  URL  pattern,  like
          &quot;OPTIONS *&quot;.

          Example:
           curl --request-target &quot;*&quot; -X OPTIONS https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   -X, --request &lt;command&gt;
          (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
          ing with the HTTP server.  The specified request method will  be
          used  instead  of  the  method otherwise used (which defaults to
          GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details  and  explana-
          tions.  Common  additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE,
          but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
          and more.

          Normally  you  don't  need  this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD,
          POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
          mand line options.

          This  option  only  changes the actual word used in the HTTP re-
          quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if
          you  want  to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not
          suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.

          The method string you set with -X, --request will  be  used  for
          all  requests,  which  if you for example use -L, --location may
          cause unintended side-effects when curl doesn't  change  request
          method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

          (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
          doing file lists with FTP.

          (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
          RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)

          (IMAP)  Specifies  a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST.
          (Added in 7.30.0)

          (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or
          VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -X &quot;DELETE&quot; https://example.com
           curl -X NLST ftp://example.com/

   --resolve &lt;[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...&gt;
          Provide  a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Us-
          ing this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified  ad-
          dress  and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to be
          used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative  provided  on
          the  command line. The port number should be the number used for
          the specific protocol the host will be used for.  It  means  you
          need several entries if you want to provide address for the same
          host but different ports.

          By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any  host
          and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-
          solved last so any --resolve with a specific host and port  will
          be used first.

          The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,
          --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.
          By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time out
          after  curl's  default  timeout  (1 minute). Note that this will
          only make sense for long running parallel transfers with  a  lot
          of files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to
          resolve the host as it normally would once the timeout  has  ex-
          pired.

          Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added
          in 7.57.0.

          Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was  added
          in 7.59.0.

          Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

          Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

          This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-
          solve.

          Example:
           curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.3.

   --retry-all-errors
          Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

          This option is the &quot;sledgehammer&quot; of retrying. Do not  use  this
          option by default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended conse-
          quences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not  use
          with  redirected  input or output. You'd be much better off han-
          dling your unique problems in shell script. Please read the  ex-
          ample below.

          WARNING:  For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed
          flaky transfers as close as possible to how they  were  started,
          but  this  is  not possible with redirected input or output. For
          example, before retrying it removes output data  from  a  failed
          partial  transfer  that  was  written to an output file. However
          this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or &gt; file, which
          are  not reset. We strongly suggest don't parse or record output
          via redirect in combination with this option, since you may  re-
          ceive duplicate data.

          By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that in-
          dicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was successful. For exam-
          ple,  if  a  server replies 404 Not Found and the reply is fully
          received then that is not an error. When --retry  is  used  then
          curl  will retry on some HTTP response codes that indicate tran-
          sient HTTP errors, but that does not include most  4xx  response
          codes  such  as  404. If you want to retry on all response codes
          that indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then  combine  with  -f,
          --fail.

          Example:
           curl --retry-all-errors https://example.com

          Added in 7.71.0.

   --retry-connrefused
          In  addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as a
          transient error too for --retry. This option  is  used  together
          with --retry.

          Example:
           curl --retry-connrefused --retry https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;
          Make  curl  sleep  this  amount of time before each retry when a
          transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes  the  de-
          fault  backoff  time  algorithm between retries). This option is
          only interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay  to
          zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry-delay 5 --retry https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          The  retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Re-
          tries will be done as usual (see --retry) as long as  the  timer
          hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't
          reached the limit, the request will be made and  while  perform-
          ing,  it may take longer than this given time period. To limit a
          single request's maximum time, use -m, --max-time.  Set this op-
          tion to zero to not timeout retries.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10 https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --retry &lt;num&gt;
          If  a  transient  error is returned when curl tries to perform a
          transfer, it will retry this number of times before  giving  up.
          Setting  the  number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
          default). Transient error means either: a timeout,  an  FTP  4xx
          response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response
          code.

          When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one
          second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the
          waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be  the
          delay  between  the rest of the retries.  By using --retry-delay
          you  disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See   also
          --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.

          Since  curl  7.66.0,  curl will comply with the Retry-After: re-
          sponse header if one was present to know when to issue the  next
          retry.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry 7 https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --sasl-authzid &lt;identity&gt;
          Use this authorisation identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-
          thentication, in addition to the authentication identity  (auth-
          cid) as specified by -u, --user.

          If  the  option  isn't specified, the server will derive the au-
          thzid from the authcid, but if specified, and depending  on  the
          server  implementation,  it may be used to access another user's
          inbox, that the user has been granted access  to,  or  a  shared
          mailbox for example.

          Example:
           curl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/

          Added in 7.66.0.

   --sasl-ir
          Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

          Example:
           curl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/

          Added in 7.31.0.

   --service-name &lt;name&gt;
          This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

          Examples:    --negotiate    --service-name   sockd   would   use
          sockd/server-name.

          Example:
           curl --service-name sockd/server https://example.com

          Added in 7.43.0.
   -S, --show-error
          When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message
          if it fails.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --show-error --silent https://example.com

          See also --no-progress-meter.

   -s, --silent
          Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  mes-
          sages.   Makes  Curl mute. It will still output the data you ask
          for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
          it.

          Use  -S,  --show-error  in  addition  to  this option to disable
          progress meter but still show error messages.

          Example:
           curl -s https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose, --stderr and --no-progress-meter.

   --socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
          fied,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. Using this socket type make
          curl resolve the host name and passing the  address  on  to  the
          proxy.

          This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks4 proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks4:// protocol prefix.
          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks4 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.15.2.

   --socks4a &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
          ified,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. This asks the proxy to re-
          solve the host name.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks4a proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks4a:// protocol  pre-
          fix.

          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks4a hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --socks5-basic
          Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connect-
          ing  to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The username/password authentication is
          enabled by default.  Use --socks5-gssapi to  force  GSS-API  au-
          thentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-basic --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   --socks5-gssapi-nec
          As  part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is negoti-
          ated. RFC 1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should  be  protected,
          but  the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The option
          --socks5-gssapi-nec allows the unprotected exchange of the  pro-
          tection mode negotiation.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi-nec --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --socks5-gssapi-service &lt;name&gt;
          The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
          This option allows you to change it.

          Examples:  --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service   sockd
          would  use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-
          service sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for  cases
          where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi-service sockd --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --socks5-gssapi
          Tells  curl  to  use GSS-API authentication when connecting to a
          SOCKS5 proxy.  The GSS-API authentication is enabled by  default
          (if  curl is compiled with GSS-API support).  Use --socks5-basic
          to force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   --socks5-hostname &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the  proxy  resolve  the
          host  name).  If the port number is not specified, it is assumed
          at port 1080.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks5 hostname proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5h:// proto-
          col prefix.

          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-hostname proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host  name  lo-
          cally.  If  the  port  number is not specified, it is assumed at
          port 1080.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks5 proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.
          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          This  option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS
          or LDAP.
          Example:
           curl --socks5 proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   -Y, --speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
          If a download is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
          ond)  for  speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set
          with -y, --speed-time and is 30 if not set.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

   -y, --speed-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second during
          a speed-time period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is
          used, the default speed-limit will be  1  unless  set  with  -Y,
          --speed-limit.

          This  option  controls  transfers  and thus will not affect slow
          connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try  the  --connect-
          timeout option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

   --ssl-allow-beast
          This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
          SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option  isn't
          used,  the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause interop-
          erability problems with some older SSL implementations.

          WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this
          flag you ask for exactly that.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-allow-beast https://example.com

          Added in 7.25.0.

   --ssl-auto-client-cert
          Tell  libcurl  to automatically locate and use a client certifi-
          cate for authentication, when requested by the server. This  op-
          tion  is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL li-
          brary). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl
          with Schannel. Since the server can request any certificate that
          supports client authentication in the OS  certificate  store  it
          could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-auto-client-cert https://example.com

          See also --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert. Added in 7.77.0.

   --ssl-no-revoke
          (Schannel) This option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
          tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
          by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-no-revoke https://example.com

          Added in 7.44.0.

   --ssl-reqd
          (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.  Termi-
          nates the connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.

          This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-reqd ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --ssl-revoke-best-effort
          (Schannel) This option tells curl to ignore certificate  revoca-
          tion checks when they failed due to missing/offline distribution
          points for the revocation check lists.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-revoke-best-effort https://example.com

          Added in 7.70.0.

   --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection.  Re-
          verts  to  a non-secure connection if the server doesn't support
          SSL/TLS.  See also --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for  differ-
          ent levels of encryption required.

          This  option  was formerly known as --ftp-ssl (Added in 7.11.0).
          That option name can still be used but will be removed in a  fu-
          ture version.

          Example:
           curl --ssl pop3://example.com/

          Added in 7.20.0.

   -2, --sslv2
          (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but start-
          ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv2 is  widely
          considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

          Example:
           curl --sslv2 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -2, --sslv2 requires that the
          underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This  option  over-
          rides -3, --sslv3 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2.

   -3, --sslv3
          (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv3, but start-
          ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv3 is  widely
          considered insecure (see RFC 7568).

          Example:
           curl --sslv3 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -3, --sslv3 requires that the
          underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This  option  over-
          rides -2, --sslv2 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2.

   --stderr &lt;file&gt;
          Redirect  all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If
          the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --stderr output.txt https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.

   --styled-output
          Enables  the automatic use of bold font styles when writing HTTP
          headers to the terminal. Use --no-styled-output to  switch  them
          off.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --styled-output -I https://example.com

          Added in 7.61.0.

   --suppress-connect-headers
          When -p, --proxytunnel is used and a  CONNECT  request  is  made
          don't  output  proxy  CONNECT  response  headers. This option is
          meant to be used with -D, --dump-header or -i,  --include  which
          are  used  to show protocol headers in the output. It has no ef-
          fect on debug options such as -v, --verbose or --trace,  or  any
          statistics.

          Example:
           curl --suppress-connect-headers --include -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -D, --dump-header, -i, --include and -p, --proxytunnel.

   --tcp-fastopen
          Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

          Example:
           curl --tcp-fastopen https://example.com

          Added in 7.49.0.

   --tcp-nodelay
          Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3) man
          page for details about this option.

          Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you  need  to
          explicitly switch it off if you don't want it on.

          Example:
           curl --tcp-nodelay https://example.com

          Added in 7.11.2.

   -t, --telnet-option &lt;opt=val&gt;
          Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

          TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

          XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

          NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

          Example:
           curl -t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

   --tftp-blksize &lt;value&gt;
          (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be &gt;512). This is the block
          size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
          a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --tftp-blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --tftp-no-options
          (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

          This  option  improves  interop with some legacy servers that do
          not acknowledge or properly implement TFTP  options.  When  this
          option is used --tftp-blksize is ignored.

          Example:
           curl --tftp-no-options tftp://192.168.0.1/

          Added in 7.48.0.

   -z, --time-cond &lt;time&gt;
          (HTTP  FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the
          given time and date, or one that has been modified  before  that
          time.  The &lt;date expression&gt; can be all sorts of date strings or
          if it doesn't match any internal ones, it is taken as a filename
          and  tries  to get the modification date (mtime) from &lt;file&gt; in-
          stead. See the curl_getdate(3) man pages for date expression de-
          tails.

          Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
          a document that is older than the given date/time, default is  a
          document that is newer than the specified date/time.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -z &quot;Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00&quot; https://example.com
           curl -z &quot;-Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00&quot; https://example.com
           curl -z file https://example.com

   --tls-max &lt;VERSION&gt;
          (SSL) VERSION defines maximum supported TLS version. The minimum
          acceptable version  is  set  by  tlsv1.0,  tlsv1.1,  tlsv1.2  or
          tlsv1.3.

          If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
          fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

          default
                 Use up to recommended TLS version.

          1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.
          1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.
          1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.
          1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

   Examples:
    curl --tls-max 1.2 https://example.com
    curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

   See also --tlsv1.0, --tlsv1.1, --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.  --tls-max  re-
   quires  that  the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in
   7.54.0.

   --tls13-ciphers &lt;ciphersuite list&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection  if
          it  negotiates  TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers suites must specify
          valid ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details  on  this
          URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          This  option  is  currently  used only when curl is built to use
          OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
          you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --ciphers
          option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

   --tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
          Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only  supported  op-
          tion  is  &quot;SRP&quot;,  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  --tlsuser  and
          --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then  this
          option  defaults to &quot;SRP&quot;.  This option works only if the under-
          lying libcurl is built  with  TLS-SRP  support,  which  requires
          OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.

          Example:
           curl --tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.

   --tlspassword &lt;string&gt;
          Set  password  for use with the TLS authentication method speci-
          fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also be set.

          This doesn't work with TLS 1.3.

          Example:
           curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.
   --tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
          Set username for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
          fied  with  --tlsauthtype.  Requires  that --tlspassword also is
          set.

          This doesn't work with TLS 1.3.

          Example:
           curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.

   --tlsv1.0
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.0, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.0 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.1
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.1, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.1 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.2
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.2, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.3
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
          fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

          Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.3 https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -1, --tlsv1
          (SSL) Tells curl to use at least TLS version 1.x when  negotiat-
          ing  with  a  remote  TLS  server. That means TLS version 1.0 or
          higher

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http2. -1, --tlsv1  requires  that  the
          underlying  libcurl  was built to support TLS. This option over-
          rides --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.

   --tr-encoding
          (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
          of  the  algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data while
          receiving it.

          Example:
           curl --tr-encoding https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.6.

   --trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;
          Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
          cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
          &quot;-&quot; as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

          This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and
          only  shows  the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output
          that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --trace-ascii log.txt https://example.com

          This option overrides --trace and -v, --verbose.

   --trace-time
          Prepends  a  time  stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl
          displays.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --trace-time --trace-ascii output https://example.com

          Added in 7.14.0.

   --trace &lt;file&gt;
          Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
          cluding descriptive information, to the given output  file.  Use
          &quot;-&quot;  as  filename  to have the output sent to stdout. Use &quot;%&quot; as
          filename to have the output sent to stderr.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --trace log.txt https://example.com

          This option overrides -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

   --unix-socket &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using
          the network.

          Example:
           curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com

          Added in 7.40.0.

   -T, --upload-file &lt;file&gt;
          This transfers the specified local file to the  remote  URL.  If
          there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the
          local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
          directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or
          curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
          name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
          fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
          be used.

          Use  the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
          given file.  Alternately, the file name &quot;.&quot;  (a  single  period)
          may  be  specified  instead  of &quot;-&quot; to use stdin in non-blocking
          mode to allow reading server output while  stdin  is  being  up-
          loaded.

          You  can  specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on the com-
          mand line. Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies  what  to
          upload  and  to  where. curl also supports &quot;globbing&quot; of the -T,
          --upload-file argument, meaning that  you  can  upload  multiple
          files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style sup-
          ported in the URL.

          When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data  is  assumed
          to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
          headers and mail body formatted correctly by the  user  as  curl
          will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

          Examples:
           curl -T file https://example.com
           curl -T &quot;img[1-1000].png&quot; ftp://ftp.example.com/
           curl --upload-file &quot;{file1,file2}&quot; https://example.com

   --url &lt;url&gt;
          Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
          want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

          If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as &quot;http://&quot;  or
          &quot;ftp://&quot;  etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host. If
          the outermost sub-domain name matches  DICT,  FTP,  IMAP,  LDAP,
          POP3  or  SMTP  then  that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
          will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
          default protocol, see --proto-default for details.

          This  option  may  be used any number of times. To control where
          this URL is written, use the -o, --output or the  -O,  --remote-
          name options.

          WARNING:  On  Windows,  particular  file:// accesses can be con-
          verted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!

          Example:
           curl --url https://example.com

   -B, --use-ascii
          (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be  en-
          forced  by  using  a  URL  that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;. This option
          causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

          Example:
           curl -B ftp://example.com/README

   -A, --user-agent &lt;name&gt;
          (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
          To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
          quote marks. This header can also be set with the  -H,  --header
          or the --proxy-header options.

          If  you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (&quot;&quot;), it will
          remove the header completely from the request. If you  prefer  a
          blank header, you can set it to a single space (&quot; &quot;).

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl -A &quot;Agent 007&quot; https://example.com

   -u, --user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
          tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

          If you simply specify the user name,  curl  will  prompt  for  a
          password.

          The  user  name  and  passwords are split up on the first colon,
          which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user  name  with
          this option. The password can, still.

          On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
          ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
          dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
          system as they will still be visible for a brief  moment  before
          cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
          stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
          When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based  server  you  should
          include  the  Windows domain name in the user name, in order for
          the server to successfully obtain  a  Kerberos  Ticket.  If  you
          don't then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

          When  using  NTLM,  the user name can be specified simply as the
          user name, without the domain, if there is a single  domain  and
          forest in your setup for example.

          To  specify  the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
          UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
          user@example.com respectively.

          If  you  use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Ker-
          beros V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you  can
          tell  curl  to select the user name and password from your envi-
          ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl -u user:secret https://example.com

   -v, --verbose
          Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging
          and  seeing  what's  going  on &quot;under the hood&quot;. A line starting
          with '&gt;' means &quot;header data&quot; sent by  curl,  '&lt;'  means  &quot;header
          data&quot;  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a
          line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

          If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
          be the option you're looking for.

          If  you think this option still doesn't give you enough details,
          consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.

          Example:
           curl --verbose https://example.com

          See  also  -i,  --include.  This  option  overrides  --trace and
          --trace-ascii.

   -V, --version
          Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.
          The first line includes the full version of  curl,  libcurl  and
          other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

          The  second  line (starts with &quot;Protocols:&quot;) shows all protocols
          that libcurl reports to support.

          The third line (starts with &quot;Features:&quot;) shows specific features
          libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

          alt-svc
                 Support for the Alt-Svc: header is provided.

          AsynchDNS
                 This  curl  uses asynchronous name resolves. Asynchronous

                 NTLM delegation to winbind helper is supported.

          PSL    PSL  is  short for Public Suffix List and means that this
                 curl has been built with  knowledge  about  &quot;public  suf-
                 fixes&quot;.

          SPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.

   Example:
    curl --version

   -w, --write-out &lt;format&gt;
          Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
          fer.  The  format  is a string that may contain plain text mixed
          with any number of variables. The format can be specified  as  a
          literal  &quot;string&quot;,  or  you can have curl read the format from a
          file with &quot;@filename&quot; and to tell curl to read the  format  from
          stdin you write &quot;@-&quot;.

          The  variables  present in the output format will be substituted
          by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as  described  below.
          All  variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a
          normal % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline  by
          using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

          The  output  will be written to standard output, but this can be
          switched to standard error by using %{stderr}.

          NOTE: The %-symbol is a special symbol in the win32-environment,
          where  all  occurrences of % must be doubled when using this op-
          tion.

          The variables available are:

          content_type   The Content-Type of the  requested  document,  if
                         there was any.

          errormsg       The error message. (Added in 7.75.0)

          exitcode       The numerical exitcode of the transfer. (Added in
                         7.75.0)

          filename_effective
                         The ultimate filename that curl  writes  out  to.
                         This  is only meaningful if curl is told to write
                         to a file  with  the  -O,  --remote-name  or  -o,
                         --output  option. It's most useful in combination
                         with the -J, --remote-header-name option.  (Added
                         in 7.26.0)

          ftp_entry_path The initial path curl ended up in when logging on
                         to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)

          http_code      The numerical response code that was found in the
                         last  retrieved  HTTP(S)  or  FTP(s) transfer. In
                         7.18.2 the alias response_code was added to  show
                         the same info.

          http_connect   The numerical code that was found in the last re-
                         sponse (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT  request.

                         quest. (Added in 7.72.0)

          num_connects   Number of new connects made in the recent  trans-
                         fer. (Added in 7.12.3)

          num_headers    The number of response headers in the most recent
                         request (restarted at each
                          redirect). Note that the status line  IS  NOT  a
                         header. (Added in 7.73.0)

          num_redirects  Number of redirects that were followed in the re-
                         quest. (Added in 7.12.3)

          onerror        The rest of the  output  is  only  shown  if  the
                         transfer  returned  a  non-zero  error  (Added in
                         7.75.0)

          proxy_ssl_verify_result
                         The result of the HTTPS proxy's SSL peer certifi-
                         cate verification that was requested. 0 means the

          redirect_url   When an HTTP request was made without -L, --loca-
                         tion to follow redirects (or when --max-redirs is
                         met), this variable will show the  actual  URL  a

          stdout         From this point on, the  -w,  --write-out  output
                         will  be written to standard output.  This is the
                         default, but can be used  to  switch  back  after
                         switching to stderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)

          time_appconnect
                         The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                         til the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the  re-
                         mote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)

          time_connect   The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                         til the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
                         was completed.

          time_namelookup
                         The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                         til the name resolving was completed.

          time_pretransfer
                         The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                         til  the  file  transfer was just about to begin.
                         This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                         tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                         tocol(s) involved.

          time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                         steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer
                         and transfer before  the  final  transaction  was
                         started.  time_redirect shows the complete execu-
                         tion time for multiple  redirections.  (Added  in
                         7.12.3)

          time_starttransfer
                         The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                         til the first byte was just about  to  be  trans-
                         ferred.  This  includes time_pretransfer and also
                         the time the server needed to calculate  the  re-
                         sult.

          time_total     The  total time, in seconds, that the full opera-
                         tion lasted.

          url            The URL that was fetched. (Added in 7.75.0)

          urlnum         The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.
                         De-globbed  URLs  share  the same index number as
                         the origin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)

          url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                         ingful  if  you've  told curl to follow location:
                         headers.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl -w '%{http_code}\n' https://example.com

   --xattr
          When saving output to a file, this option tells  curl  to  store
          certain  file  metadata  in extended file attributes. Currently,
          the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP,
          the  content  type  is stored in the mime_type attribute. If the
          file system does not support extended attributes, a  warning  is
          issued.

          Example:
           curl --xattr -o storage https://example.com
</code></pre>
<p>FILES
~/.curlrc
Default config file, see -K, &ndash;config for details.</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENT
The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case.
The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it
is only available in lower case.</p>
<pre><code>   Using  an  environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as
   using the -x, --proxy option.

   http_proxy [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
          Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.
   HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
          Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

   [url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
          Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the  pro-
          tocol  is  a  protocol  that curl supports and as specified in a
          URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.

   ALL_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
          Sets the proxy server to use if no  protocol-specific  proxy  is
          set.

   NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated list of hosts/domains&gt;
          list  of  host names that shouldn't go through any proxy. If set
          to an asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts. Each name in this
          list is matched as either a domain name which contains the host-
          name, or the hostname itself.

          This environment variable disables use of the  proxy  even  when
          specified  with  the  -x,  --proxy  option. That is NO_PROXY=di-
          rect.example.com  curl  -x  http://proxy.example.com  http://di-
          rect.example.com   accesses   the   target   URL  directly,  and
          NO_PROXY=direct.example.com  curl  -x   http://proxy.example.com
          http://somewhere.example.com accesses the target URL through the
          proxy.

          The list of host names can also  be  include  numerical  IP  ad-
          dresses,  and IPv6 versions should then be given without enclos-
          ing brackets.

          IPv6 numerical addresses are compared as strings, so  they  will
          only  match  if  the  representations are the same: &quot;::1&quot; is the
          same as &quot;::0:1&quot; but they don't match.

   CURL_SSL_BACKEND &lt;TLS backend&gt;
          If curl was built with support for &quot;MultiSSL&quot;, meaning  that  it
          has  built-in  support for more than one TLS backend, this envi-
          ronment variable can be set to the case insensitive name of  the
          particular  backend  to use when curl is invoked. Setting a name
          that isn't a built-in alternative will make curl stay  with  the
          default.

          SSL  backend  names  (case-insensitive): bearssl, gnutls, gskit,
          mbedtls, mesalink, nss, openssl, rustls, schannel, secure-trans-
          port, wolfssl

   QLOGDIR &lt;directory name&gt;
          If  curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this environment
          variable to a local directory will make curl  produce  qlogs  in
          that  directory,  using  file  names named after the destination
          connection id (in hex). Do note  that  these  files  can  become
          rather large. Works with both QUIC backends.

   SSLKEYLOGFILE &lt;file name&gt;
          If  you  set this environment variable to a file name, curl will
          store TLS secrets from its connections in that file when invoked
          to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real time using net-
          work analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This works with the fol-
          lowing  TLS  backends: OpenSSL, libressl, BoringSSL, GnuTLS, NSS
          and wolfSSL.
</code></pre>
<p>PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
Since curl version 7.21.7, the proxy string may  be  specified  with  a
protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.</p>
<pre><code>   If  no  protocol  is  specified  in  the  proxy string or if the string
   doesn't match a supported one, the proxy will be  treated  as  an  HTTP
   proxy.

   The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

   http://
          Makes  it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme pre-
          fix is used.

   https://
          Makes it treated as an HTTPS proxy.

   socks4://
          Makes it the equivalent of --socks4

   socks4a://
          Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a

   socks5://
          Makes it the equivalent of --socks5

   socks5h://
          Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname
</code></pre>
<p>EXIT CODES
There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding  er-
ror  messages  that  may  appear under error conditions. At the time of
this writing, the exit codes are:</p>
<pre><code>   1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
          protocol.

   2      Failed to initialize.

   3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

   4      A  feature  or option that was needed to perform the desired re-
          quest was not enabled or was explicitly disabled at  build-time.
          To make curl able to do this, you probably need another build of
          libcurl!

   5      Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could  not  be  re-
          solved.

   6      Couldn't  resolve  host.  The given remote host could not be re-
          solved.

   7      Failed to connect to host.

   8      Weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.

   9      FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied  access  to
          the  particular  resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most
          often you tried to change to a directory that doesn't  exist  on
          the server.

   10     FTP  accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect back
          when an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent  over
          the control connection or similar.

   11     FTP  weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the
          PASS request.

   12     During an active FTP session while waiting  for  the  server  to
          connect back to curl, the timeout expired.

   13     FTP  weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the
          PASV request.

   14     FTP weird 227 format.  Curl  couldn't  parse  the  227-line  the
          server sent.

   15     FTP  can't  get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the
          227-line.

   16     HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer.
          This is somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems,
          see the error message for details.

   17     FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to  bi-
          nary.

   18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

   19     FTP  couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or simi-
          lar) command failed.

   21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
   22     HTTP page not retrieved. The requested url was not found or  re-
          turned  another  error  with  the  HTTP  error code being 400 or
          above. This return code only appears if -f, --fail is used.

   23     Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local  filesystem  or
          similar.

   25     FTP  couldn't  STOR  file. The server denied the STOR operation,
          used for FTP uploading.

   26     Read error. Various reading problems.

   27     Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.

   28     Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached ac-
          cording to the conditions.

   30     FTP  PORT  failed.  The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers
          support the PORT command, try doing a transfer  using  PASV  in-
          stead!

   31     FTP  couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is
          used for resumed FTP transfers.

   33     HTTP range error. The range &quot;command&quot; didn't work.

   34     HTTP post error. Internal post-request generation error.

   35     SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.

   36     Bad download resume. Couldn't continue an earlier aborted  down-
          load.

   37     FILE couldn't read file. Failed to open the file. Permissions?

   38     LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.

   39     LDAP search failed.

   41     Function not found. A required LDAP function was not found.

   42     Aborted by callback. An application told curl to abort the oper-
          ation.

   43     Internal error. A function was called with a bad parameter.

   45     Interface error. A specified outgoing  interface  could  not  be
          used.

   47     Too many redirects. When following redirects, curl hit the maxi-
          mum amount.

   48     Unknown option specified to libcurl.  This  indicates  that  you
          passed  a weird option to curl that was passed on to libcurl and
          rejected. Read up in the manual!

   49     Malformed telnet option.

   51     The peer's SSL certificate or SSH MD5 fingerprint was not OK.

   52     The server didn't reply anything, which here  is  considered  an
          error.

   53     SSL crypto engine not found.

   54     Cannot set SSL crypto engine as default.

   55     Failed sending network data.

   56     Failure in receiving network data.

   58     Problem with the local certificate.

   59     Couldn't use specified SSL cipher.

   60     Peer  certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certifi-
          cates.

   61     Unrecognized transfer encoding.

   62     Invalid LDAP URL.

   63     Maximum file size exceeded.

   64     Requested FTP SSL level failed.

   65     Sending the data requires a rewind that failed.

   66     Failed to initialise SSL Engine.

   67     The user name, password, or similar was not  accepted  and  curl
          failed to log in.

   68     File not found on TFTP server.

   69     Permission problem on TFTP server.

   70     Out of disk space on TFTP server.

   71     Illegal TFTP operation.

   72     Unknown TFTP transfer ID.

   73     File already exists (TFTP).

   74     No such user (TFTP).

   75     Character conversion failed.

   76     Character conversion functions required.

   77     Problem reading the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?).

   78     The resource referenced in the URL does not exist.

   79     An unspecified error occurred during the SSH session.

   80     Failed to shut down the SSL connection.

   82     Could  not  load  CRL  file,  missing  or wrong format (added in
          7.19.0).

   83     Issuer check failed (added in 7.19.0).

   84     The FTP PRET command failed.

   85     Mismatch of RTSP CSeq numbers.

   86     Mismatch of RTSP Session Identifiers.

   87     Unable to parse FTP file list.

   88     FTP chunk callback reported error.

   89     No connection available, the session will be queued.

   90     SSL public key does not matched pinned public key.

   91     Invalid SSL certificate status.

   92     Stream error in HTTP/2 framing layer.

   93     An API function was called from inside a callback.

   94     An authentication function returned an error.

   95     A problem was detected in the HTTP/3  layer.  This  is  somewhat
          generic  and  can  be one out of several problems, see the error
          message for details.

   96     QUIC connection error. This error may be caused by  an  SSL  li-
          brary error. QUIC is the protocol used for HTTP/3 transfers.

   XX     More error codes will appear here in future releases. The exist-
          ing ones are meant to never change.

<h2 id="dinkus">dinkus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical &ldquo;break&rdquo; of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>In computer science, transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by hypertext reference. Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user. The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transclusion facilitates modular design: a resource  is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents. Updates or corrections to a resource are then reflected in any referencing documents. Ted Nelson coined the term for his 1980 nonlinear book Literary Machines, but the idea of master copy and occurrences was applied 17 years before, in Sketchpad.

<p><em>From Wikipedia</em>:
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;Theocracy&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; is a form of government in which one or more [[deity|deities]] of some type are recognized as supreme ruling authorities, giving divine guidance to human intermediaries who manage the day-to-day affairs of the government.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Webster&rsquo;s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 edition).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;[<a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/theocracy">www.oxforddictionaries.com/definitio&hellip;</a> Theocracy, n.]&quot; in &lsquo;&lsquo;Oxford English Dictionary&rsquo;&rsquo; (2015); Retrieved 28 June 2015<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>==Etymology==
The word theocracy originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word θεοκρατία (&lsquo;&lsquo;theocratia&rsquo;') meaning &ldquo;the rule of God&rdquo;. This, in turn, derives from [[:wikt:θεός|θεός]] (theos), meaning &ldquo;god&rdquo;, and [[:wikt:κρατέω|κρατέω]] (&lsquo;&lsquo;krateo&rsquo;'), meaning &ldquo;to rule&rdquo;. Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was &ldquo;rule by god(s)&rdquo; or human <a href="s">[incarnation]</a> of god(s).</p>
<p>The term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century AD to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following three types: [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. However, according to Josephus, the government of the Jews was unique. Josephus offered the term &ldquo;theocracy&rdquo; to describe this polity in which God was sovereign and His word was law.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{{cite book|url=<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm">www.gutenberg.org/files/284&hellip;</a>|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org|date=October 2001}}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Josephus&rsquo; definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term took on negative [[connotation]]s and was barely salvaged by [[Hegel]]&rsquo;s commentary.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{{Cite journal|last=Moked|first=Oran|date=2004|title=The Relationship between Religion and State in Hegel&rsquo;s Thought|journal=Hegel Bulletin|language=en|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=96–112|doi=10.1017/S0263523200002032|issn=2051-5367|doi-access=free}}<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning &ldquo;sacerdotal government under divine inspiration&rdquo; (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning &ldquo;priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power&rdquo; was recorded in 1825.</p>
<p>==Definition==
{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}
The term &lsquo;&lsquo;theocracy&rsquo;&rsquo; derives from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}}, &ldquo;rule of God&rdquo;, a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]],<!-- raw HTML omitted -->English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').
The Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn&rsquo;t attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[Nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a &ldquo;strained expression&rdquo;.
W. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], &lsquo;&lsquo;Against Apion&rsquo;&rsquo; ii. §17 (1814) IV. 340: &ldquo;He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy&rdquo;, translating  {{lang|grc|ὡς δ&rsquo;ἄν τίς εἴποι, βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον, θεοκρατίαν}}
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reflecting the view that &ldquo;God himself is recognized as the head&rdquo; of the state.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm">www.newadvent.org/cathen/14&hellip;</a> Catholic Encyclopedia] &ldquo;A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen Palmquist, [<a href="http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth">www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth</a> &lsquo;&lsquo;Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy&rsquo;'] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though &ldquo;non-political&rdquo;) political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the deity or deities of that civilization&rsquo;s religion or belief, such as [[Muhammad]]&rsquo;s leadership of the early Muslims with prophecies from [[God in Islam|Allah]]. In an ecclesiocracy, the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation.</p>
<p>A related phenomenon is a secular government co-existing with a state religion or delegating some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in Israel, [[Marriage in Israel|marriage]] is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion) exists, nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Hook - 2x]
We gone swang, lane to lane
Still gripping the wood grain, collecting my change
We gone swang, lane to lane
In the wide frame, on Fondren and Main
 
[Dougie D]
Fucking with G, the skating Escalade
Flossing all through the city, swanging from lane to lane
Gripping wooden grain, that's the way we do it mayn
On a constant grind working jelly, collecting change
In a wide frame, big body overloading the road
Hogging the street, just like they always be out of control
Roll with us, or you bitches get rolled over
Ain't no chip on my shoulder, I just got money to fold up
It's the Dougie Deezie, off of the heezy please believe me
Gotta be keeping it greasy, for me to see the cheesy
Doing it like it go, and there's one thing I know fa sho
We gon shine and gon hold, because the 3rd Coast is our home

[Trae]
See I'm a grain gripping, 83 swanger
Chromy glass, nigga you in danger
Got a sawed off, that'll repaint you
In a wide body, like the Lone Ranger
I'ma stop and drop, when I wanna roll
I got a big four do', with a big fo'-fo'
Sitting solo, Doug-O wrecked
Now Trae done backdo'
Ghetto superstar, menage tois
Candy paint, done wet up the car
Lane to lane, my drop'll get raw
Running red lights, and don't bar the law
Gotta get paid, stacking my change
Gripping the grain, gliding mayn
Turn out the back, and I'ma gon swang
Untamed, fin to do my thang
Now Trae done wrecked it, world respected
Out the Southside, of Houston Texas
Living wreckless, don't neglect it
Moving on, and ain't baring plexas
Bubble eyed, fin to lead the way
Diamonds shining, like a heat wave
Back it up, 'fore I blind your face
Slow Loud And Bangin', fin to lead the race

[Hook - 2x]

[Jay'Ton]
I swing blocks, when I'm in the drop
Where the throwed bops, and the haters jock
It's Jay'Ton on 84's, Volvos fin to glide the road
I'm 16 all in your face, braided up and I'm out of sight
With a bad dyke on a motor bike, screened up lighting up the night
I'm blue red coming out the I, turning heads on the boulevard
My AK'll make a nigga know, when I cock it back I'm fin to hit you hard
Southside fin to go get it, all about stacking a mill ticket
I'm still playa don't get it twisted, sideways with the trunk lifted

[Lil' B]
The window tinter, wood grain gripper
Wet candy paint, and a chrome pistol
Eyes on me, like a thoed stripper
Showing naked, better take a picture
On the boulevard we don't guard
84's and vogues, down to South Park
Cause I'm Lil' B, and I don't barge
Slow Loud And Bangin', we'll pull your car
That's on the Lord, we'll leave a stain
Hogging lanes, in a wide frame
With my nigga too, all against the grain
On the Dirty South, is where we gon swang
Riding two deep, or solo
Platinum FUBU, or Polo
With a bad hoe, rocking J-Lo
Skating up the block, I'm crawling slow

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Solid, as a rock
Profiling in the turning lane, banging down your block
Hell naw it just don't stop, matter fact it never slow down
When I'm in the kitchen whipping, my prices tend to go down
Then I dog my Intrepid, mash on the gas on down to the flo'
Till I hit my block and set up shop, anything you need come to the Ro
Might got prices on my head but I'm not scared, I'm gon shine
Relaxing in Rolls Royces, attempting to pass time
I be smoking on that stink, had to retire from that ink
Cause you just can't think, when your mind goes blank
Full tank of unleaded, then I'm head to Probilla
Fucking with that Big Mello, because my click require killas
You ain't gotta holla at me, when you see me outside
Cause when I go to my ride, I got your woman inside
She got her mouth open wide, ready for me to drop it in
My shine is unstoppable, but you wanna stop it here we go again

[Hook - 4x]

</ul>
<p>An oligopoly (from Greek ὀλίγος, oligos &ldquo;few&rdquo; and πωλεῖν, polein &ldquo;to sell&rdquo;) is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of large sellers or producers. Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, leading to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, leading to higher prices for consumers and lower wages for employees.</p>
<p>Many industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.</p>
<p>Most countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies.</p>
<p>It is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role.</p>

<p><em>From LookUp</em>:
Onomastics (or, in older texts, onomatology) is the study of the etymology, history, and use of proper names. An orthonym is the proper name of the object in question, the object of onomastic study.</p>
<p>Onomastics can be helpful in data mining, with applications such as named-entity recognition, or recognition of the origin of names. It is a popular approach in historical research, where it can be used to identify ethnic minorities within wider populations and for the purpose of prosopography.</p>

<p>This shortcut anticipates the upcoming addition of individual term share URLs to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448"><strong>LookUp</strong></a> for iOS/iPadOS/macOS (and therefore requires one currently be running a <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/L8DSerhw">Testflight build</a>.)</p>
<p>By default, it should be present in the share sheet, from which it receives URLs, extracts the term from the URL format, formats the results as a markdown hyperlink, which it then copies to the system clipboard.</p>

			 <p>iconographic cannibalism</p>
<p><code>2022.03.22 20:15</code> T - <a href="https://tilde.town/~bx/">bx</a>
as far as im aware &ldquo;iconographic cannibalism&rdquo; is a phrase
that im gur first to put into use, i came up with it to
describe a specific phenomenon where i dont want to eat
things that looks too much like inocent or other wise joy
filled human beings, this includes ginger bread people,
some kinds of cake(m&amp;s sells one that looks like a plump
anropomorphised catipillar named collin) and also gur
licorice allsort that looks like gur mascot, which is
just a person shaped collection of licorice allsorts (and
in gur actual pack its a smaller piece of single licorice
shaped gur same way).</p>
<p>ultimately i dont want to eat them because itd make me
sad, i tend to personify allot of things in my mind and
having it allready presented that way kind of exagerates
that, i dont want to eat some ginger bread if it means
brutally dissmembering someone, same for any goes for any
other food.</p>
<p>id considered that maybe gingerbread people would be
eatable if they were made in gur image of someone who
was already dead or deserved such a fate, but making a
hitler gingerbread person feels like id not only be
sullying gur good name and nature ginger bread people as
a species, but thatd id be morally at fault for birthing
a ginger bread person with fascist tendancies just to be
comfortable eating something shaped like a human.
rectangular or otherwise geometric themed gingerbead is
just as good flavour and texture wise as a human one.
i cant remember how many years its been since i ate a
ginger bread person, here&rsquo;s to not being cannibals.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_(religious_retreat)">Hermitage (religious retreat)</a>” - <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
<p>A hermitage most authentically refers to a place where a hermit lives in seclusion from the world, or a building or settlement where a person or a group of people lived religiously, in seclusion. Particularly as a name or part of the name of properties its meaning is often imprecise, harking to a distant period of local history, components of the building material, or recalling any former sanctuary or holy place. Secondary churches or establishments run from a monastery were often called &ldquo;hermitages&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, some owners of English country houses adorned their gardens with a &ldquo;hermitage&rdquo;, sometimes a Gothic ruin, but sometimes, as at Painshill Park, a romantic hut which a &ldquo;hermit&rdquo; was recruited to occupy. The so-called Ermita de San Pelayo y San Isidoro is the ruins of a Romanesque church of Ávila, Spain that ended up several hundred miles away, to feature in the Buen Retiro Park in Madrid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gouache (; French: [ɡwaʃ]), body color, or opaque watercolor, is a water-medium paint consisting of natural pigment, water, a binding agent (usually gum arabic or dextrin), and sometimes additional inert material. Gouache is designed to be opaque. Gouache has a considerable history, having been used for at least twelve centuries. It is used most consistently by commercial artists for posters, illustrations, comics, and other design work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gouache is similar to watercolor in that it can be re-wetted and dries to a matte finish, and the paint can become infused into its paper support. It is similar to acrylic or oil paints in that it is normally used in an opaque painting style and it can form a superficial layer. Many manufacturers of watercolor paints also produce gouache, and the two can easily be used together.

<p><em>Galumph</em> means &ldquo;to move with a clumsy heavy tread.&rdquo;
// After long days at his landscaping job, their teenage son <em>galumphs</em> into the house and flings himself onto the couch, sighing heavily.

<p>&ldquo;One moment he&rsquo;d be <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pitter-patter">pitter-pattering</a>…; the next he&rsquo;d be whirling and <em>galumphing</em> about the stage.&rdquo; — Jeffrey Gantz, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, 8 Feb. 2022</p>

<h2 id="did-you-know">Did You Know?</h2>
<p>Bump, thump, thud. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it—when someone or something galumphs onto the scene, ears take notice. <em>Galumph</em> first lumbered onto the English scene in 1872 when Lewis Carroll used the word to describe the actions of the vanquisher of the Jabberwock in <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>: &ldquo;He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.&rdquo; Carroll likely constructed the word by splicing _<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gallop">gallop_</a> and _<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triumphant">triumphant_</a> (<em>galumph</em> did in its earliest uses convey a sense of exultant bounding). Other 19th-century writers must have liked the sound of <em>galumph</em>, because they began plying it in their own prose, and it has been <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clump#h2">clumping</a> around our language ever since.</p>

<p>A fursona is a personalized animal character created by someone in the furry fandom. The term fursona is a portmanteau furry and persona. The vast majority of furries have fursonas; the Anthropomorphic Research Project states that nearly every furry has a fursona, and The New Science of Narcissism estimates the amount at 95%. The Anthropomorphic Research Project additionally states that the average furry has 2.12 fursonas over the course of their life.Fursonas may be anthropomorphic personas, idealized versions of their owners, fleshed out roleplay characters, or simply digital mascots. A small minority of furries express a desire to become, or already see themselves as, their fursona&rsquo;s species. These people may additionally identify as therians or otherkin.Individuals' fursonas are acted out primarily online, but also at furry conventions and in other public spaces. Acting out one&rsquo;s fursona in person may involve wearing a fursuit.

<p><em>From Wikipedia</em>
Eschatology concerns expectations of the end of the present age, human history, or of the world itself. The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions, which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as apocalypticism, and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by doomsday cults. In the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the divine. Various religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore.</p>
<p>The Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In later Judaism, the term &ldquo;end of days&rdquo; makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Some forms of Christianity depict the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. In Islam, the Day of Judgment is preceded by the appearance of the Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, and followed by the descending of ʿĪsā (Jesus), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the Qiyāmah (Judgment Day).</p>
<p>Dharmic religions tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by decay, redemption, and rebirth (though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful). In Hinduism, the end time occurs when Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, descends atop a white horse and brings an end to the current Kali Yuga, completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In Buddhism, the Buddha predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a bodhisattva named Maitreya will appear and rediscover the teachings of the Buddha Dharma, and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.</p>
<p>Since the development of the concept of deep time in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated age of planet Earth, scientific discourse about end times has considered the ultimate fate of the universe. Theories have included the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, and Big Freeze (heat death). Social and scientific commentators also worry about global catastrophic risks and scenarios that could result in human extinction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A doof or bush doof is a type of outdoor dance party generally held in a remote country area, or outside a large city in surrounding bush or rainforest. Originating in the post-punk electronic music scene of Melbourne, Australia in the early 1990s, events referred to as doofs are now held worldwide and have built from a small set of social groups to a subculture with millions of active members worldwide, considered by some as a full blown culture similar to raves or teknivals. Doofs generally have healing workshops, speakers, art, live artists and DJs playing a range of electronic music, commonly goa, house, dub techno, Techno, acid heavy sounds and psychedelic trance.

			 <blockquote>
<p>In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical &ldquo;break&rdquo; of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.</p>

The aesthetic centres on traditional rural clothing, interior design, and crafts such as drawing, baking, and pottery, and is related to similar aesthetic movements such as grandmacore, farmcore, goblincore, and fairycore.Some sources describe cottagecore as a subculture of Millennials and Generation Z.</p>

<ol>
<li>a formal procession of people walking, on horseback, or riding in vehicles
the royal cavalcade proceeded through the city</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>late 16th century (denoting a ride or raid on horseback): from French, from Italian cavalcata, from cavalcare ‘to ride’, based on Latin caballus ‘horse’</p>
<h2 id="wikipedia">Wikipedia</h2>
<p>A cavalcade is a procession or parade on horseback, or a mass trail ride by a company of riders.  The focus of a cavalcade is participation rather than display. Often, the participants do not wear costumes or ride in formation. Often, a cavalcade re-enacts an important historical event and follows a long-distance trail.  A cavalcade may also be a pilgrimage.
Many cavalcades involve ceremonial entries into and departures from towns and villages along the way.  A small version of such a ceremonial entry is the &ldquo;grand entry&rdquo; that is traditional in many rodeos.  Long-distance cavalcades may acquire more riders who join from populated places along its route.</p>
<p>The term cavalcade comes from the classical Latin word caballus, used to describe a strong work horse.  This developed into the word caballicare, &ldquo;to ride horseback,&rdquo; which in Italian became cavalcare. In Spanish the term for cavalcade is cabalgata.</p>

<p>In Christianity, an anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress) is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, or Eucharist-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop.The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. In the Catholic Church today, it is one of the &ldquo;Other Forms of Consecrated Life&rdquo; and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. In medieval England, the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century. Their highest number—around 200 anchorites—were recorded in the 13th century.From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.Between 1536 and 1539, the dissolution of the monasteries ordered by Henry VIII of England effectively brought the anchorite tradition to an end.</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler can help you automatically launch a program or <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2018/10/22/introduction-to-powershell/">PowerShell</a> script at a certain time or when certain conditions are met. You can also schedule sending emails and even displaying certain messages. In this blog, we will show you how to run a PowerShell script from Task Scheduler that will alert on any software installation on a local computer.</p>
<p>We will also create scheduled tasks using PowerShell scripts. You will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Tasks with Task Scheduler</li>
<li>Modify or Delete Scheduled Tasks</li>
<li>Create Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell Scripts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-tasks-with-task-scheduler">Creating Tasks with Task Scheduler</h2>
<p>Open Task Scheduler by pressing “Windows+R” and then typing “taskschd.msc” in the window that opens. Then take the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Click “Create a task” and enter a name and description for the new task. To run the program with administrator privileges, check the “Run with the highest privileges” box. In our example, we’ll assign a service account to run the task, and run it regardless of whether the user is logged on.<br>
<img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task1.png" alt="PowerShell Creating tasks with Task Scheduler step 1"></p>
<p>2. Switch to the Triggers tab and click the “New…” button. Here you can specify the conditions that trigger the task to be executed. For example, you can have it executed on schedule, at logon, on idle, at startup or whenever a particular event occurs. We want our task to be triggered by any new software installation, so we choose “On an event” from the drop-down menu and select “Application” from the Log settings. Leave the “Source” parameter blank and set the EventID to “11707”. Click “OK” to save the changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task2.png" alt="PowerShell Creating tasks with Task Scheduler step 2"></p>
<p>3. Navigate to the “Actions” tab, and click “New…”. Here you can specify the actions that will be executed whenever the trigger conditions are met. For instance, you can send an email or display a message. In our case, we want to start a program, so we need to create the PowerShell script we want to run and save it with the “ps1” extension. You can find the script <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/how_to_detect_software_installations.html?itm_source=blog&amp;itm_medium=context&amp;itm_campaign=powershell&amp;itm_content=none&amp;cID=70170000000kgEZ">here</a>; it will send an alert with the event details about the installed software.</p>
<p>To schedule the PowerShell script, specify the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Start a program</li>
<li><strong>Program\script:</strong> powershell</li>
<li><strong>Add arguments (optional):</strong> -File <em>[Specify the file path to the script here]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Click “OK” to save your changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task3.png" alt="PowerShell Creating tasks with Task Scheduler step 3"></p>
<p>4. The “Conditions” tab enables you to specify the conditions that, along with the trigger, determine whether the task should be run. In our case, we should leave the default settings on this tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task4.png" alt="PowerShell Creating tasks with Task Scheduler step 4"></p>
<p>5. You can also set up additional parameters for your scheduled task on the “Settings” tab. For our example, though, we’ll leave them unchanged.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task5.png" alt="PowerShell Creating tasks with Task Scheduler step 5"></p>
<p>6. When the task is completely set up, the system will ask you for the service account password. Note that this account must have the “Log on as Batch Job” right. Enter the password and click “OK” to save the task.<br>
7. For Task Scheduler to function properly, the Job Scheduler service must be set to start Run “<strong>Services.msc</strong>”. In the list of services, find Task Scheduler and double-click it. On the General tab, set the startup type to “Automatic” and click OK to save your change.</p>
<p>Now whenever new software is installed on your Microsoft Windows Server, you will be notified via an email that details the time of the installation, the name of the software and the user ID (SID) of the person who installed it.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-or-deleting-scheduled-tasks">Modifying or Deleting Scheduled Tasks</h2>
<p>To modify an existing task, right-click it in the list, select Properties, edit the required settings and click OK. To delete a scheduled task, right-click it, select Delete and confirm the action.</p>
<h2 id="creating-scheduled-tasks-with-powershell-scripts">Creating Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell Scripts</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to create a task using Task Scheduler, let’s find out how to create a scheduled task using PowerShell. Suppose we want our task to be launched daily at 10 AM, and it must execute the PowerShell script you can find <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/how_to_monitor_ad_group_membership_changes.html?itm_source=blog&amp;itm_medium=context&amp;itm_campaign=powershell&amp;itm_content=none&amp;cID=70170000000kgEZ">here</a>, which will monitor changes to group membership in the <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/what_is_active_directory_ebook.html?cID=70170000000kgEZ" title="https://www.Netwrix.com/what_is_active_directory_ebook.html">Active Directory</a> site.</p>
<p>In Windows Powershell 2.0 (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2), to create a scheduled job, you must use the <strong>TaskScheduler</strong> module. Install the module by running the “<strong>Import-Module TaskScheduler</strong>” command and use the following script to create a task that will execute the PowerShell script named <strong>GroupMembershipChanges.ps1</strong> daily at 10 AM:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Import-Module TaskScheduler $task = New-Task
$task.Settings.Hidden = $true
Add-TaskAction -Task $task -Path C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe –Arguments “-File C:\Scripts\GroupMembershipChanges.ps1”
Add-TaskTrigger -Task $task -Daily -At “10:00”
Register-ScheduledJob –Name ”Monitor Group Management” -Task $task
</code></pre><p>Windows PowerShell 4.0 (Windows Server 2012 R2 and above) doesn’t include the Task Scheduler module, so this script will not work. Instead, PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0 introduced new cmdlets for creating scheduled tasks, <strong>New-ScheduledTaskTrigger</strong> and <strong>Register-ScheduledTask</strong>, which make creating a scheduled task much easier and more convenient. So let’s create a task that will execute our script daily at 10 AM using the system account (SYSTEM). This task will be performed by an account with elevated privileges.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$Trigger= New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -At 10:00am –Daily # Specify the trigger settings
$User= &quot;NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM&quot; # Specify the account to run the script
$Action= New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute &quot;PowerShell.exe&quot; -Argument &quot;C:\PS\StartupScript.ps1&quot; # Specify what program to run and with its parameters
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName &quot;MonitorGroupMembership&quot; -Trigger $Trigger -User $User -Action $Action -RunLevel Highest –Force # Specify the name of the task
</code></pre><p><img src="https://blog.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Task6.png" alt="Creating Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell Scripts"></p>
<p>Other trigger options that could be useful in creating new tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-AtStartup</strong> — Triggers your task at Windows startup.</li>
<li><strong>-AtLogon</strong> — Triggers your task when the user signs in.</li>
<li><strong>-Once</strong> — Triggers your task once. You can set a repetition interval using the <strong>–RepetitionInterval</strong> parameter**.**</li>
<li><strong>-Weekly</strong> — Triggers your task once a week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, using these cmdlets, it is not possible to trigger execution “on an event” as we did with the Task Scheduler tool. PowerShell scripts with “on an event” triggers are much more complicated, so this is a real disadvantage of using PowerShell rather than Task Scheduler.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, it is easy to create scheduled tasks using Task Scheduler or PowerShell. But remember that improper changes to your scheduled tasks can cause service interruptions and degrade server performance. Therefore, it’s essential to track all changes to your scheduled tasks.</p>

Howdy, folks!

This is a semi-formal announcement, I suppose.

I've created a very simple Telegram bot (@ColumbiaMOBot) in the interest of perhaps adding some more utility to this group, especially considering how quiet the humans have been, lately.

I am very much open to suggestions/requests/help in terms of adding functionality to the bot, going forward. 

Initially, all I've done is (temporarily, if need be) added the RSS feed for the columbiamo subreddit, which means (as currently configured,) you'll be seeing the bot post links to all new threads in said subreddit fairly promptly after they are submitted.

I'm going to respond as soon as I can to this message with an anonymous poll regarding this specific addition - please do vote honestly. The results will determine whether or not autoposting from this one subreddit continues.

(I've just peeked at the feed contents, themselves, in an RSS reader, and honestly it doesn't seem lively enough to be disruptive, but I guess we'll see.)

Also! For documentation's sake, here's the issue on the group's GitHub Repository regarding the bot's development.

<h2 id="south-korea-is-poised-to-take-japans-place-in-the-american-market">South Korea is poised to take Japan&rsquo;s place in the American market.</h2>
<p>The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were all overpriced, devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with many other non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging generation of management. This group decided that the ideal way to run their business involved expending the least amount of effort into their products as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers. Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that this thinking just&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t work. I would theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top sellers of the automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally symbolized the best in quality, luxury and performance. Consumer and producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishing market. It was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the joy began seeping out of our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor. Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion. It reflected in the cars that were built. Designs were reused, progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost. “American dependability” became an ironic statement.</p>
<p>And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier, proudly displaying a banner the changing public couldn&rsquo;t refuse. They offered a product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like high value. An odor that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America&rsquo;s new family pet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college student&rsquo;s greatest companion. Both were conservatively styled and equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the country wanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our aging interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath of fresh air. So. What made the newcomers so different? What was the driving force behind the value of the products? It was something not unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed. Picture an ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something to the order of “Lets build the best automobile we can and sell it for as little as possible.” Though the man is more a symbol than an actual influence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his name, he represents what led to the same group&rsquo;s success. Honda was untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they built good cars.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/C5R7hZa.jpeg" alt="Accord Mark One"></p>
<p>By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along with the level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord and Civic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held their titles for a relatively long time. It was then that I personally theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken only a short while before. I don&rsquo;t want to brag, but this was long before Ron Kiino&rsquo;s bold title “Is Hyundai the new Honda?” graced the pages of MotorTrend&rsquo;s October 2011 issue. And it was really a far-fetched notion at the time. Simply a suspicion. Confidently and stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the United States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but even more ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has always been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise driving. They both held their slightly different niches, with no real fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on quality. Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy, aging transmissions, and a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011 Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/JwoqLyt.jpeg" alt="Sonata Front"></p>
<p>This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord/Camry duo. In previous generations, it had always been competitively priced. The quality, though, had been lacking. The Koreans were not afraid to design a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants. However, the designs were never really all that great looking. Interesting and different? Yes. Attractive?&hellip;.No. So these attributes kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not intimidated by Hyundai&rsquo;s offering. And that&rsquo;s quite understandable. The Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor to the giants. The new one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it&rsquo;s gorgeous. Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way. Poised and angular, the exterior looks as if it should cost exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata&rsquo;s tradition of unique styling by rejecting the old car completely and replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude. It&rsquo;s not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than any other mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of 19,195 USD (£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/s3Kfq8g.jpeg" alt="Sonata Interior"></p>
<p>All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It&rsquo;s interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda&rsquo;s original niche, given how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality was created by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former, however, was founded as a massive construction firm, only later trying its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for Hyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s just a sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155785511-14f16190-1a42-4afc-b69c-6b1377dba6ae.jpeg" alt="Apple Rag"></p>
<h2 id="a-quick-review-of-apple-incs-first-venture-as-a-textile-company">A quick review of Apple, Inc’s first venture as a textile company.</h2>
<p>Now that Apple, Incorporated is a textile company, I thought it might be pertinent of me - someone with incredibly filthy hands - to review its first textile product, the Rag. Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. <em>It’s not good for it</em>, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251502745">Oleophobic coating</a> away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.</p>
<p>What’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected"><em>Connected</em></a>[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how <em>sparsely</em> Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question <a href="https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/836622115880828961/947175164800565248">in the <em>MacStories</em> Discord</a> to only a single response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that&rsquo;s only when I really notice the screen being dirty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155851075-a933d702-8fd0-480d-aaae-a4322d2e46a6.jpeg" alt="Rag on Couch"></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I must admit - it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning <em>truly</em> grubby surfaces. As far as I know, it’s not washable - I probably shouldn’t have thrown the packaging away, but I didn’t expect to review it.</p>
<p>I would advise a strong, rotational approach under moderate pressure when using the Rag on your device’s screen. I would not advise you use it on your face or hands. I also would not advise you use it to clean your dog’s paws after a muddy bout. More reasonably, it’s not even all that great for cleaning glasses lenses. (It might just be that mine are particularly dirty.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It sounds a bit silly, but $20 is actually a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single microfiber cloth. I’d link you alternatives, but I’m committed to never sharing Amazon links on this here blog. For what it’s worth, the Apple Rag appears to have a strong resistance to liquids (they just fall off,) and a truly unique competency at cleaning glass screens.</p>

<p>Hello again, Town. Since I last posted here, I’ve actually engaged in the forum, written a wee bit at the end of <a href="https://tilde.town/graffiti.html">Town Graffiti</a>, and even engaged some with Town Chat. I’ve also updated <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">my page</a> quite extensively with all sorts of local links. A Mastodon friend called my <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews">App Store reviews index</a> a “really cool idea,” but it actually reflects an inexcusable level of negligence, on my part.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154950874-0b339971-3dfb-40d5-b42c-0afea3e6e8ef.png" alt="Graffiti Tone"></p>
<p>As always, I’m working on far too many things at once, and I definitely do not want This Post to become another one. Perhaps I should ban hyperlinks in the future? I don’t know&hellip; here’s a hyperlink to where you can respond: p̯e̶ḝ̴̸̡̢̦͖̺̐͟͢͞͞.</p>

<p>So, so many years have passed since the last time I spent any extended periods sitting in an IRC chat. I’m sure you’ve heard that a billion times, but - unlike most other modern chat settings, imo - I think TildeTown is one of the few places where IRC genuinely makes sense over any other protocol. In <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink">my in-progress guide</a> to using <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581">Blink Shell</a> with Tilde.Town, I described WeeChat’s “onboarding process” (forgive me) as <em>dubitable</em> (see below.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>.</p>

			 <p>In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of <em>The Nice, Huge Estate</em>, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.</p>
<p>Theodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was <em>especially</em> reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all <em>his</em>, without a single worthy challenger.</p>
<p>In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been <em>even more</em> otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at <em>Nice, Huge</em> – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.</p>
<p>The latest favorite pastime of <em>Nice, Big</em>’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.</p>
<p>“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You’re not <em>busy</em>, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.</p>
<p>“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Finally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.</p>
<p>“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”</p>
<p>Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say <em>guffaw.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”</p>
<p>Lenny Lather had not… <em>could not</em> have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.</p>
<p>“Jesus <em>Christ!</em>” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said <em>BLOOD</em> in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been <em>guffawing</em> plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-<em>guffawing</em> – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.</p>
<p>As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.</p>
<p>“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.</p>
<p>“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.</p>
<p>“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Right-o, as you say, sir!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Down to the <em>pu-hb</em> for a <em>spaht</em> of <em>brahn</em>-dee with me <em>mae-its</em>!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<em>Oncemo-ar</em> right, pip pip!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“By <em>jah-lee</em>, there we are!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named <em>BLOOD</em> had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot <em>BLOOD</em> had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as <em>BLOOD</em> had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.</p>
<p>“<em>Jesus Christ</em>,” had said the shortest.</p>
<p>“<em>Holy fuck,</em>” had said the youngest.</p>
<p>“<em>Gee whiz</em>,” had said the oldest.</p>
<p>And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes <em>BLOOD</em>’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “<em>FUCK!</em>”</p>
<p>The Sucking’s <em>FUCK</em> and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic <em>guffaws</em> with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.</p>
<p>“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my <em>best</em> Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.</p>
<p>“Tally-<em>ho</em>, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to <em>sneak</em> for a swift, full-chat <em>dart</em>, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his <em>People</em> Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, <em>excuse me</em>-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in <em>his</em> store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food &amp; Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been <em>in spite</em>. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.</p>
<p>Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his <em>excuse me</em> lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys &amp; Leather.</p>
<p>“Sir! Excuse me!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<em>Excuse me!</em> Sir!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”</p>
<p>Keys &amp; Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”</p>
<p>“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys &amp; Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation <em>and</em> arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.</p>
<p>“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish <em>haha!</em> before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.</p>
<p>“Man, <em>come on</em>,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.</p>
<p>After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that <em>BLOOD</em> and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me <em>alone</em>?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.</p>
<p>“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.</p>
<p>“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As <em>BLOOD</em>’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-<em>BOOM!</em>”</p>
<p>Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify <em>BLOOD</em> by <em>name</em> from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their <em>effectiveness</em>, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.</p>

<h2 id="the-ideal-means-of-on-the-go-participation-in-the-tildeverse">The ideal means of <em>On The Go</em> participation in The Tildeverse.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story - documented in <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">a Medium post</a> by <em>WIRED</em> Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford - until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png" alt="iSH Shell and a-Shell"></p>
<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306"><strong>Blink Shell &amp; Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png" alt="bbj Out"></p>
<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href="https://blink.sh">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href="https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png" alt="Apreche Reply"></p>
<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136">public pages</a> - exclusively through <a href="https://github.com/extratone/jorts">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note <a href="https://tilde.town/~apreche">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png" alt="Blink Settings"></p>
<h2 id="locally">Locally</h2>
<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes">themes</a> - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js">CLRS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js">Man Page</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png" alt="Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage"></p>
<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png" alt="Repository Cleaning"></p>
<p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png" alt="BaityYouTubeThumbnail"></p>
<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png" alt="Blink and Code"></p>
<p>Blink’s own “<a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png" alt="Blink Keyboard Shortcuts"></p>
<h3 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>
<p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>
<p>After a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png" alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"></p>
<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png" alt="Importing Keys in Blink Shell"></p>
<h2 id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>
<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png" alt="Blink Autocomplete"></p>
<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>

<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>
<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>
<pre><code>{
  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,
  “AltitudeRef” : 0,
  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,
  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,
  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,
  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,
  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,
  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,
  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,
  “DOP” : 35
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>
<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>
<h4 id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>
<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fset</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format &quot;%M&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FhjqlFV1.png" alt="Spacedust Chat-Minimal"></p>
<p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.</p>

<h2 id="town-television">Town Television</h2>
<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png" alt="Blink Appearance Settings"></p>
<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png" alt="Notifications in Blink"></p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>
<p>Blink has a URL scheme - <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>
<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>
<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown <a href="https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup">here</a> and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307">here</a>.</p>

We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.</h2>
<p>The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump&rsquo;s antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many &lsquo;a&rsquo; feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and - though the net is undoubtedly positive - a few have gone.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude <a href="https://micro.blog/s">@s</a> on all of Twitter&rsquo;s proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you&rsquo;ll hear many familiar terms in the chants: <em>limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.</em></p>
<p>These conversations are important, but they&rsquo;ve gotten awfully stale.</p>
<p>If you listen a bit more carefully, you&rsquo;ll intercept a new one:</p>
<p><em>Mastodon</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who&rsquo;s known colloquially as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron">Gargron</a>.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had one hell of a week.</p>
<p>Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship <a href="http://mastodon.social/">mastadon.social</a> instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on <em>The Verge</em>&rsquo;s front page.</p>
<p>Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with being called <em>Eugene</em> by Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the ink&rsquo;s still fresh on his compsci diploma, he&rsquo;s clearly prepared for the American press.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?</strong></p>
<p>Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> was first created - at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.</p>
<p>A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as &ldquo;Hellbird,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the bird website.&rdquo; Eugen isn&rsquo;t afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.</p>
<p>I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn&rsquo;t happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.</p>
<p>He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck&rsquo;s standard in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought &lsquo;if I&rsquo;m going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.&rsquo; I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought &lsquo;okay, it works. that&rsquo;s great.&rsquo; Then, exams came.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786">Patreon page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346">announced</a> it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That&rsquo;s when I got my first users who weren&rsquo;t my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project - GNU social - did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. <a href="https://twitter.com/aral">Aral Balkan</a> - a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers - picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including <em><a href="http://mastodon.social/@extratone">Extratone</a></em> and <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">I</a>.)</p>
<p>Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That&rsquo;s when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.</p>

<p><em>Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the last - now a bit out of date - is this week&rsquo;s spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.</p>
<p><strong>Are you responsible for all of the code?</strong></p>
<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">GitHub page</a> to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who&rsquo;ve contributed interesting, good features &amp; fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind the name?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not particularly interesting. I&rsquo;m a progressive metal fan, and I listen to <em>Mastodon</em> sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It&rsquo;s a fluffy elephant! What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the inspiration for Mastodon&rsquo;s mascot, which was penned by Rochko&rsquo;s YouTuber friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo">Dopatwo</a> after he realized how urgently he required an error page.</p>
<p><strong>What does &ldquo;federated&rdquo; mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest problem with this term is that it&rsquo;s new for lots of people. People who&rsquo;ve come across federated networks in the past <em>instantly</em> understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn&rsquo;t understand what &lsquo;retweeting&rsquo; meant, so it&rsquo;s not a unique problem domain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from - maybe BitTorrent - but people seem to think that when something is &lsquo;decentralized,&rsquo; everybody gets the same thing; that it&rsquo;s all synchronized one to one. In actuality, &lsquo;federated&rsquo; means that people in different instances can <em>talk</em> to each other, but the <em>content</em> is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.</p>
<p>Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances.</p>
<p><strong>What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?</strong></p>
<p>[Rochko laughs.]</p>
<p>If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and - depending on the company - could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I&rsquo;d be in the clear, legally?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s okay. The code is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a> version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes.</p>
<p>For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.</p>
<p>To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I&rsquo;m using this license.</p>
<p>The thing to remember about free software is that &lsquo;free&rsquo; means <em>freedom of the user,</em> not that it&rsquo;s zero cost. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of multilingual &lsquo;tooting&rsquo; these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter&rsquo;s on Mastodon?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could put in a &lsquo;translate this toot&rsquo; button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I&rsquo;m not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French.</p>
<p><strong>The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn&rsquo;t already been addressed here is the capability of editable &lsquo;toots.&rsquo; Is that a possibility?</strong></p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t happen. There&rsquo;s actually a good reason why they don&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says &lsquo;Heil Hitler,&rsquo; or something.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png" alt="Mastotile"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time.</p>
<p>That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation <em>do</em> warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you&rsquo;ll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you&rsquo;ll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While <em>FOSS</em> and <em>Federated</em> may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you&rsquo;ll find an audience. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll be your command line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an <em>alternative</em> or <em>clone</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like Twitter&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp; democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn&rsquo;t ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who&rsquo;ve been let down by the tools you&rsquo;ve been given to control your words' exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it&rsquo;s also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.</p>
<p>Sarah Jeong&rsquo;s <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it">account</a> of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you&rsquo;re craving more specifics, and Eugen&rsquo;s <a href="https://medium.com/@Gargron">Medium</a> offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source. Apparently, he&rsquo;s just as articulate with words as he is with code.</p>
<p>If I had to hazard a guess, I&rsquo;d bet it&rsquo;s <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/eugen.rochko/">not the last we&rsquo;ll hear from him</a>.</p>
