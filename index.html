<p>For the past few days, at least, Google&rsquo;s Gemini had been bothering me to try some &ldquo;new&rdquo; &ldquo;image editing&rdquo; function, but I did not relent until this morning, when I thought of a Funny Idea&hellip;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-ad-prompt" data-lang="ad-prompt">Retouch this (scan of an old 35mm print) photo *as* a vintage film photo and then turn it into cover art for Ace Combat 11: Go Around.

Absolutely! Here's your retouched photo, transformed into the cover art for Ace Combat 11: Go Around!

<p>Of the more humorous potential uses for the upcoming <code>Use Model</code> actions, I think, is this series of tests (all done within the Shortcuts app) of Apple Intelligence's default actions against <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta">the Navy SEAL copypasta</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the following was appended to the end of every result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Writing Tools aren’t designed to work with this type of content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Summarize</h2>
<p>A Navy SEAL threatens violence and retribution against someone who made an online comment, claiming extensive combat training and access to military resources.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threat Level</strong>: The sender claims to be a highly trained Navy Seal with numerous confirmed kills and access to a vast network of spies.</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong>: The sender is targeting the recipient of the message, claiming to have traced their IP address and vowing to wipe them out.</li>
<li><strong>Reason for Threat</strong>: The sender is angry about a comment made by the recipient online, which they perceive as disrespectful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make List from</h2>
<ul>
<li>The speaker claims to be a highly trained and experienced member of the military.</li>
<li>They mention their involvement in secret raids and having a high kill count.</li>
<li>The speaker claims to be skilled in gorilla warfare and sniping.</li>
<li>They express a desire to eliminate the person they are speaking to with precision.</li>

<li>They threaten to destroy the person’s life and mention their ability to kill in multiple ways.</li>
<li>The speaker claims to have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps.</li>
<li>They express a desire to use their military training and resources to eliminate the person they are speaking to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rewrite</h2>
<p>What on earth did you just say about me, you little bitch? I’ll make it clear that I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals. I’ve been involved in numerous covert raids against Al-Qaeda, and I’ve personally confirmed over 300 kills.</p>
<p>I’m trained in gorilla warfare and hold the title of the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You’re nothing more to me than just another target. I’ll eliminate you with precision that’s unparalleled on this planet, mark my words.</p>
<p>Do you think you can get away with making such a statement to me over the Internet? Think again, you fool. As I speak, I’m contacting my secret network of spies across the USA, and your IP address is being traced right now. So, prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that will obliterate the pathetic existence you call your life. You’re dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands.</p>
<p>Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I also have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps. I’ll use it to its fullest extent to obliterate your miserable existence from the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you had realized the unholy retribution your “clever” comment was about to unleash upon you, you might have held your tongue.</p>
<p>But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I’ll unleash fury upon you, and you’ll drown in it.</p>
<p>You’re dead, kiddo.</p>
<h2>Professional Tone</h2>
<p>I am writing to express my strong disagreement with your recent statement. I would like to clarify that I graduated at the top of my class in the Navy Seals and have participated in numerous covert operations against Al-Qaeda, resulting in over 300 confirmed kills.</p>
<p>I am trained in gorilla warfare and am the top sniper in the United States Armed Forces. Your statement is unacceptable, and I will respond with precision and force.</p>
<p>I am currently contacting my network of informants across the United States, and your IP address is being traced. You should prepare for the consequences of your actions. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can eliminate you in numerous ways.</p>
<p>I am extensively trained in unarmed combat and have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps. I will use it to its full extent to eliminate you. If you had known the severity of your statement, you would have refrained from making it.</p>
<p>I am currently retaliating against you, and you will be held accountable for your actions.</p>

<p>One of the only unambiguous extended pleasures I experienced in 2020 was that of reading all five volumes of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cazalet-Chronicle-Collection-Elizabeth-Howard/dp/150987898X?utm_source=a"><strong>The Cazalet Chronicles</strong></a>,” by Elizabeth Jane Howard, back to back. “Sunlight refurbished the room,” Howard writes, in the first paragraph, “making toffee of the linoleum, turning the chips on the white enamel washstand jug slate blue.” That calm, bright, tarnished deliciousness—the immediate re-attunement of your attention to the slow secret unfolding of a summer’s day—that’s just what it feels like to read these books, which refract the political and social upheaval of the twenty years surrounding the Second World War through the life of an upper-middle-class English family.</p>
<p>“The Cazalet Chronicles” is the sort of series, like “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Hall-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0312429983?utm_source=a">Wolf Hall</a>” or “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032?utm_source=a">The Three-Body Problem</a>” or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Patrick-Melrose-Novels-Mothers/dp/1250069602?utm_source=a">Patrick Melrose novels</a>, that inspires active jealousy within me when a friend goes in for the first time. But, unlike the other occupants of this category, “The Cazalet Chronicles” remain shockingly underread and underpraised. Hilary Mantel once supposed that Howard’s work was dismissed both because of her private life (she married Kingsley Amis, and counted Arthur Koestler and Cecil Day-Lewis among her many suitors) and because of the centrality of the domestic in her work. Howard’s was the sort of fiction that’s thought, Mantel wrote, to be by women and for women; novels that “seldom try to startle or provoke the reader; on the contrary, though the narrative may unfold ingeniously, every art is employed to make the reader at ease within it.” Of course, the home—even and especially one as luscious as the Cazalet countryside estate—is the site of a thousand turns and deceptions and revelations, heightened by the comfort that both the reader and the characters feel. My best pitch for “The Cazalet Chronicles”: they’re a cross between Laurie Colwin and Elena Ferrante, with more than a bit of the Evan S. Connell masterpiece “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Bridge-Evan-S-Connell/dp/1582435685">Mrs. Bridge</a>.” Read these books before they get the inevitable makeover and reissue that they’re due.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>~2000-2001:</strong> Miguel de Icaza and others start the GNOME desktop environment project for Linux. GNOME 1.2 is released with issues, including shipping with five different clock applications. This experience informs de Icaza&rsquo;s later development philosophies, specifically the idea of avoiding unnecessary options and complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Xogot Development (Undated, implied years prior to GodotCon 2024):</strong> Miguel de Icaza works on Swift language bindings for Godot Engine as a GD Extension. He also works with another fellow named Nat Friedman to create Mono, an open-source .NET implementation, which Unity Engine is later built around.</li>
<li><strong>Prior to GodotCon 2024:</strong> Initial work is done on a &ldquo;libgodot&rdquo; approach for embedding Godot within other applications. Miguel de Icaza expresses his dream of this functionality to Juan.</li>
<li><strong>GodotCon 2024:</strong> Miguel de Icaza gives a talk detailing the development of Xogot, a project to bring Godot Engine to the iPad. He explains the challenges of adapting Godot&rsquo;s desktop-centric UI for a touch interface and the approach of using Swift UI as a separate UI layer communicating with the Godot editor core (the source of truth). He highlights the successful virtualization of the Godot editor and game running simultaneously by manipulating a variable pointing to the application&rsquo;s state. He also mentions the limitations of the platform, such as only supporting GDScript and not supporting third-party C++ GD Extensions due to Apple&rsquo;s security policies. The goal is to achieve an Apple Design Award. The beta test program is announced, requiring a TestFlight ID or Apple ID and information on needed GD Extensions.</li>
<li><strong>November 13, 2024:</strong> Users begin discussing Git issues related to dubious ownership. Joseph.hill confirms receipt of requests for beta access.</li>
<li><strong>November 14, 2024:</strong> Djemergency reports a visual bug with export variables not displaying correctly (e.g., &ldquo;walkingSpeed&rdquo; appearing as &ldquo;walkingSpeed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Walking Speed&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>November 15, 2024:</strong> Hyouuu. requests beta access. Miguel de Icaza confirms he will process requests later.</li>
<li><strong>November 16, 2024:</strong> Miguel de Icaza announces a new batch of beta testers has been invited. Several users, including russellup.art, trueh_91782, hilidice, brunotor, bpgam3z, and silent_rkgk, confirm joining the server and express excitement. Discussions about server administration and behavior occur.</li>
<li><strong>November 17, 2024:</strong> Discussions about visual shaders and the potential to replace the visual editor dock occur. Detox0236 requests the status bar be hidden for fullscreen testing. Wolfybl is noted for being impatient about getting beta access. Joseph.hill sends out a tranche of invites. Miguel de Icaza notes they haven&rsquo;t done any rejections for the beta. Discussion about the TestFlight beta duration (90 days). Users confirm projects can be created on the desktop Godot version and transferred to the Xogot folder on iPad.</li>
<li><strong>November 18, 2024:</strong> Miguel de Icaza comments on viewport issues.</li>
<li><strong>November 19, 2024:</strong> Clancey asks detox0236 about having multiple games in their GitHub repo. Detox0236 confirms. Miguel de Icaza notes an issue with something triggering a stop. Ciidi inquires if an invalid method after variables in a script could cause this and mentions random green highlighting in the script editor. A link to a GitHub repository of &ldquo;godot-ipad-demos&rdquo; by celyk is shared.</li>
<li><strong>November 20, 2024:</strong> Endritdev expresses appreciation for the &ldquo;Infinite Canvas&rdquo; demo. Detox0236 clarifies their request for a hidden status bar is for running the scene embedded, but Miguel de Icaza initially thought they meant on its own scene. Miguel de Icaza considers running the scene in the same window for more control over fullscreen.</li>
<li><strong>November 22, 2024:</strong> Miguel de Icaza reports that a Skeleton3D issue uncovered multiple issues and he is close to fixing them. Mascaz offers to continue testing once fixes are out.</li>
<li><strong>November 23, 2024:</strong> Detox0236 notes that Xogot pauses music playback. Andrekling asks about the code window adjusting in vertical mode. Users discuss the lack of support for C++ GD Extensions. Paraxikology confirms their custom extensions are not public. Firesonwires notes that C# extensions likely won&rsquo;t be possible either due to JIT.</li>
<li><strong>November 24, 2024:</strong> Endritdev mentions the Windows development of their personal project. Miguel de Icaza confirms that C++ GD Extensions and C# extensions won&rsquo;t be possible for a while but has an idea for native ones.</li>
<li><strong>November 25, 2024:</strong> Users comment positively on the visual appearance of Xogot. Miguel de Icaza advises kindness in discussions. Wolfybl and thedarkwaterbun confirm knowing each other from another server. Vernacular mentions their Apple devices sharing data. Clancey suggests asking Apple for an exception for Xogot regarding data sharing. Vernacular humorously dismisses the idea due to homework.</li>
<li><strong>November 26, 2024:</strong> Vernacular and Clancey discuss Apple device data sharing. Miguel de Icaza reacts with a smiley face.</li>
<li><strong>November 27, 2024:</strong> Verxion suggests using Xogot for homework. Joseph.hill sends out another wave of invites. Detox0236 comments on the user data sharing.</li>
<li><strong>November 28, 2024:</strong> Endritdev asks if game building/exporting is possible or will be included. Miguel de Icaza confirms James is working on an &ldquo;export game&rdquo; feature in developer mode. Victororange_ observes that invites seem to be sent in batches in the mornings.</li>
<li><strong>November 29, 2024:</strong> Joseph.hill sends out a fresh batch of invites. Paraxikology asks if Xogot will be locked to Godot 4.3. Josephsmth relays that Miguel de Icaza&rsquo;s talk indicated relatively easy updates to new Godot versions, including the upcoming 4.4 with Metal support.</li>
<li><strong>November 30, 2024:</strong> Endritdev highlights the need for visual tools for curves, color ramps, and gradients, noting that standard Godot has these.</li>
<li><strong>December 1, 2024:</strong> Miguel de Icaza anticipates finding many touch scenarios needing improvement and wants a catalog of these.

</ul>
<h4 id="key-themes-and-important-ideas"><strong>Key Themes and Important Ideas:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Godot Engine: Open-Source, Feature-Rich, and Community-Driven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-Source and Licensing:</strong> The Godot Engine is clearly presented as an open-source project, primarily under the <strong>MIT license</strong>. This is evident in the GitHub repositories for both the documentation and the FPS starter kit, as well as explicitly stated in the Godot documentation itself (&ldquo;View license&rdquo;). The MIT license allows for significant freedom in using, modifying, and distributing the software, including for commercial purposes. The assets included in the KenneyNL FPS starter kit are explicitly mentioned as <strong>CC0 licensed</strong>, meaning they are in the public domain.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> The extensive list of topics covered in the Godot documentation (2D/3D graphics, physics, scripting, audio, networking, etc.) highlights the engine&rsquo;s breadth of features and the detailed resources available to developers. The documentation repository is a significant part of the Godot ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Platform Support:</strong> Godot is designed to be multi-platform, supporting various operating systems for both the editor and exported projects (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, web, etc.). The documentation details export options for different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting and Extendability:</strong> Godot supports multiple programming languages, including its own GDScript and C#. The concept of <strong>GD Extensions</strong> is mentioned as a way to extend the engine&rsquo;s functionality, particularly with languages like Swift and C++.</li>
<li><strong>Development Practices:</strong> The documentation touches on best practices for project organization, using different node types, handling data, and optimizing performance. It also mentions the warning system in GDScript and how to use tool mode (@tool) for running code in the editor.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning and Release Policy:</strong> The documentation outlines Godot&rsquo;s versioning and release policy, including guidance on which version to use for new projects and upgrading existing ones. The provided sources reference Godot 4.3 and the upcoming 4.4, which is expected to include Metal support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Xogot: Bringing Godot to the iPad with Swift UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Porting to iPad:</strong> Miguel de Icaza&rsquo;s talk and the Discord conversations highlight the significant challenges of bringing a desktop-focused game engine like Godot to the iPad. Key issues include:</li>
<li><strong>Input Differences:</strong> Godot is designed for mouse and keyboard, while the iPad relies on touch and optional accessories like the Apple Pencil and external keyboards. This requires a significant redesign of the UI and interaction methods.</li>
<li><strong>Touch Target Size:</strong> Apple&rsquo;s requirement for a minimum tapable region (44 points, roughly 150 pixels) necessitates larger UI elements than typically found in the desktop Godot editor.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Gestures:</strong> iPad users expect certain gestures to be available, which need to be implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> While iPads have powerful chips (M series), optimizing performance on a mobile device is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Apple&rsquo;s Security and App Store Policies:</strong> These policies, particularly regarding code signing and the loading of dynamic libraries, pose limitations on supporting features like third-party C++ GD Extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Swift UI as the Solution:</strong> The Xogot project leverages <strong>Swift UI</strong> to build a native iPad user interface. The key advantage of Swift UI, according to Miguel de Icaza, is its declarative approach and focus on a &ldquo;source of truth,&rdquo; which simplifies UI updates based on data model changes.</li>
<li><strong>LibGodot:</strong> A fundamental component of Xogot is the use of <strong>libgodot.a</strong>, a modular build of the Godot core engine. This allows Xogot to embed Godot views and content within the Swift UI application, enabling the mixing of native and engine elements.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization of Godot State:</strong> A significant technical achievement discussed is the virtualization of Godot&rsquo;s global state. This allows the Xogot application to run both the editor and a game instance simultaneously by &ldquo;ping-ponging&rdquo; a variable that points to the respective state.</li>
<li>&ldquo;essentially every time that there&rsquo;s an access to a global variable&hellip; it would allocate it and instead what I did is I would have a big ass variable that contained the state of the whole app&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;and the trick is all you got to do is change that jro variable so J points there it&rsquo;s the editor then you change it and it points there and now it&rsquo;s the game&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Reorganizing the UI for iPad:</strong> To address the limitations and expectations of the iPad, the Xogot UI is being significantly redesigned. This includes:</li>
<li>Rewriting high-traffic dialogues in Swift UI.</li>
<li>Simplifying or removing features from the editor UI to save space, with the understanding that users can return to the desktop version for full configuration.</li>
<li>Adjusting the visual presentation of elements like font data.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Xogot:</strong> Due to Apple&rsquo;s policies and the project&rsquo;s current stage:</li>
<li>Only <strong>GDScript</strong> is supported as the scripting language.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party C++ GD Extensions are not supported</strong>, as dynamically loading code is restricted. Popular extensions may be bundled in the future.</li>
<li>Support for <strong>C# GD Extensions</strong> is also limited due to the need for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which is generally restricted on iOS.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Development and Beta Testing:</strong> The Discord conversations demonstrate active development, bug fixing, and beta testing with a community of users. Users are reporting bugs related to various aspects of the editor and engine, such as:</li>
<li>Invalid states in animations.</li>
<li>Issues with TileSets and TileMaps.</li>
<li>Crashes related to script editor tabs.</li>
<li>Visual bugs in the UI.</li>
<li>Problems with specific nodes and their properties (e.g., Label tab stop values, ColorRect).</li>
<li>Performance concerns, particularly on lower-end iPads.</li>
<li>Trouble with procedural sound generation.</li>
<li><strong>Features Being Implemented and Explored:</strong> The team is actively working on and discussing various features:</li>
<li>Implementing native editors for different Godot components (TileSet, TileMapLayer, Animation, Debugger, Output).</li>
<li>Improving visual editors (e.g., for shaders, curves, gradients).</li>
<li>Adding paint functionality to the TileSet editor.</li>
<li>Supporting running games embedded within the editor.</li>
<li>Implementing features for managing projects and assets (e.g., rescanning the file system, supporting addons).</li>
<li>Adding support for external displays.</li>
<li>Exploring support for running local LLMs.</li>
<li>Considering support for Vision Pro and iPhone (though iPhone support is seen as more challenging due to the need for a full experience).</li>
<li>Discussing the implementation of Feature Tags for conditional code based on platform or configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization and Future Vision:</strong> There are discussions about the future of Xogot, including its potential cost and target audience. While there is testing of a paywall in the beta (with no actual charges), the final monetization model is not yet decided. Miguel de Icaza&rsquo;s vision seems to be more than just a simple port, aiming for an Apple Design Award and providing a robust game development experience on the iPad. There is also excitement about the potential for <strong>embedding Godot scenes within native iOS/Android/Mac apps using libgodot</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Godot Project Examples and Resources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FPS Starter Kit:</strong> The KenneyNL FPS Starter Kit provides a concrete example of a Godot project, showcasing basic FPS features like a character controller, weapons, enemies, and the use of sprites and 3D models. This highlights the types of projects that can be created with Godot.</li>
<li><strong>Godot Documentation as a Resource:</strong> The detailed documentation on Godot&rsquo;s features and development practices serves as a vital resource for developers using the engine, including those working with Xogot.</li>

<h3 id="integration-note">Integration Note</h3>
<p>Hello! I am here to act as your paid consultant and thought partner, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you&rsquo;ve provided to help you quickly analyze information and develop strategic recommendations. I have access to excerpts from the Xogot App Store release notes, documentation on differences between Xogot and Godot, Godot export documentation for iOS, Xogot FAQ, Xogot Getting Started guides, Reddit discussions about Godot on mobile and iOS, Godot 4.4 documentation, Xogot documentation on various topics like UI, assets, controls, TestFlight notes, a blog post about Xogot on iPadOS, Product Hunt reviews, the Xogot App Store listing, and Discord chat logs related to Xogot features, bugs, and discussions. I can help you navigate these materials, understand complex topics, and formulate well-supported insights.</p>
<p>Xogot is designed to integrate closely with existing Godot development workflows and tools, aiming to provide a native iPad experience that complements, rather than replaces, desktop Godot usage. The core principle is to build upon the powerful, open-source Godot engine, making it accessible and effective on a touch-first device like the iPad.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how Xogot integrates with existing Godot workflows and tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project Compatibility and Mobility</strong>: A fundamental aspect of Xogot&rsquo;s integration is project compatibility. Projects created in Xogot are intended to be fully compatible with the desktop edition of Godot. This allows users to move projects back and forth between the two platforms.
<ul>
<li><strong>Importing Projects</strong>: Existing Godot projects can be brought into Xogot using the Files App integration. This involves saving project files to a location accessible by the Files App (like iCloud Drive) and then copying them into the Xogot folder on the iPad. If the project is large, re-importing assets can take some time.</li>
<li><strong>Using Version Control</strong>: Xogot recommends using native iOS Git clients like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. Users can clone repositories directly into the Xogot projects area or add existing project folders in Xogot as linked repositories in Working Copy. Pushing changes and using linked folders with Working Copy requires a Pro unlock. While Xogot itself does not have native Git support, this workflow allows users to manage their Godot projects with Git on the iPad.</li>
<li><strong>Exporting Projects</strong>: Xogot currently supports exporting projects to WebAssembly, which can be shared via a link for playtesting in a web browser. Other export options, such as exporting for iOS (which requires a macOS machine and Xcode), Android, Windows, or other platforms, must be done using Godot on the desktop. The process for exporting a Godot project to Xcode for iOS development involves using the Godot editor&rsquo;s export window on macOS, setting up required Apple Developer account information, and then building and deploying from Xcode. For active development, Godot project files can be linked directly into an Xcode project to avoid re-exporting after every change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface and Experience</strong>: Xogot&rsquo;s UI is a significant area of adaptation from standard Godot. It is specifically designed to be touch-friendly and align with iPadOS conventions.
<ul>
<li><strong>iPadOS Adaptation</strong>: This includes making UI elements more tappable, simplifying parts of the interface to conserve screen real estate, and replacing some toolbar icons with Apple&rsquo;s SF Symbols. Tooltips, which rely on hovering, are not surfaced due to the iPad&rsquo;s touch interface.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid UI Approach</strong>: Instead of fully rewriting the entire Godot editor UI in SwiftUI, Xogot uses a hybrid approach. It has a native SwiftUI shell that embeds Godot views as a library (libgodot). High-traffic or critical dialogues are being rewritten natively in SwiftUI for a better touch experience, such as the TileSet and TileMapLayer editors, the Audio bus editor, and the Shader Editor. Less frequently used or plugin-specific UI elements might still embed the original Godot views.</li>
<li><strong>Differences from Godot UI</strong>: While aiming for a native feel, this results in some differences from the desktop Godot UI. For example, Project Settings navigation is adapted. Some users miss the classic Godot node icons, though Xogot offers an option to use them instead of SF Symbols. There are ongoing discussions and work based on user feedback to tune the UI and bring back or adapt features for a better workflow on iPad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Supported Scripting and Extensions</strong>: A key difference and limitation in Xogot compared to desktop Godot is the supported scripting languages and extensions.
<ul>
<li><strong>GDScript Only</strong>: Xogot exclusively supports Godot&rsquo;s built-in scripting language, GDScript.</li>
<li><strong>No Compiled Languages</strong>: Support for other compiled languages like C#, C++, Swift, or Rust is not included in Xogot. This means projects or addons written in these languages are unlikely to work directly in Xogot. While Godot 4.2+ experimentally supports exporting C# projects to iOS, this is a function of the desktop editor, not Xogot itself. Adding support for C# or arbitrary compiled GDExtensions in Xogot is not currently planned due to technical hurdles related to Apple&rsquo;s policies on arbitrary code execution and toolchain inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>GDScript Addons</strong>: Addons and plugins written solely in GDScript are supported and can be enabled via project settings. Users place the addon code in the &lsquo;addons&rsquo; directory within the project folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Editor Functionality</strong>: Xogot provides access to most core Godot editor functionalities, adapted for the iPad experience.
<ul>
<li><strong>Editors</strong>: Includes dedicated editors for 2D and 3D scenes, a script editor, animation editor, and tilemap/tileset editors. Recent improvements have focused on native SwiftUI rewrites for key editors like TileSet and TileMapLayer.</li>
<li><strong>Inspector and Settings</strong>: The Inspector and Project Settings panels are available, with some UI adaptations for iPad. All Project Settings from Godot are intended to be available, though the UI for navigating them is different.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger</strong>: A fully integrated debugger is included, supporting breakpoints, exploring program state, and profiling. Runtime errors are surfaced with descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Importing</strong>: Supports common asset types (sprites, textures, sounds, 3D models) and provides multiple ways to import them directly on the iPad via Files App or drag and drop. Specific formats like .gltf and .obj for 3D models are supported with notes on required accompanying files.</li>
<li><strong>Input Handling</strong>: Provides support for various input devices, including external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers. A notable feature is the built-in iOS virtual controller, which maps to Xbox button conventions and can be configured via the Input Map in Project Settings. This allows quick testing of desktop projects on iPad without requiring custom touch controls. Users can also manually add touch controls like the Virtual Joystick Addon. There have been reports and fixes related to multi-touch event handling in the editor and running games. Support for accelerometer/gyroscope is available but might require exporting the game to test fully.</li>
<li><strong>Rendering</strong>: Xogot is based on Godot 4.4+. It supports Godot&rsquo;s rendering engines (Metal, Vulkan) and rendering methods (Mobile, Forward+, OpenGL), configurable in Project Settings. Metal backend support is integrated.</li>
<li><strong>External Displays and Multitasking</strong>: Supports iPadOS multitasking features like Split View and Stage Manager, allowing work across multiple displays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Xogot includes integrated learning resources to help users get started.
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Provides integrated API documentation and tutorials. This includes Xogot-specific guides (like Getting Started, UI, Importing Assets, Onscreen Controls, Working with Git) and documentation on differences from Godot. Links to the official Godot documentation are also beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Projects</strong>: Comes preloaded with sample projects in the &ldquo;Learning Center&rdquo; to help users explore features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, Xogot functions as a Godot editor specifically tailored for iPadOS. It maintains project compatibility with desktop Godot, allowing developers to seamlessly transition their work. While it adapts the UI for touch and leverages native iOS features, it currently focuses on GDScript and doesn&rsquo;t support compiled languages or arbitrary GDExtensions, requiring desktop Godot for projects dependent on these. Core editor functionalities are present and being actively refined for the touch environment, alongside built-in learning resources.</p>
<p>As a next step, considering the focus on compatibility and the unique iPad workflow, you might want to investigate the specific performance characteristics of Xogot compared to desktop Godot for different types of projects (e.g., 2D vs 3D, asset heavy vs code heavy) to understand the practical limitations and ideal use cases for developing solely or partially on iPad.</p>
<h3 id="technical-considerations-and-limitations-note">Technical Considerations and Limitations Note</h3>
<p>As your paid consultant and thought partner, I will now detail the unique technical considerations and limitations when using Xogot, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you&rsquo;ve provided. I have access to a range of materials including release notes, documentation on differences and features, Godot export guides, Reddit discussions, and Discord chat logs, which allow me to analyze Xogot from technical, operational, and user perspective.</p>
<p>Xogot is built upon the robust Godot engine but is specifically engineered for the iPadOS environment, which introduces several technical considerations and limitations that differ from the standard desktop Godot experience. These considerations are primarily driven by the architecture of iPadOS, Apple&rsquo;s platform policies, and the design choices made to optimize for a touch-first interface.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed breakdown of the unique technical considerations and limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Architecture and Process Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xogot employs a hybrid architecture, using a native SwiftUI shell to embed Godot engine views via <code>libgodot</code>. This approach allows for a more native iPadOS feel while leveraging the core Godot functionality.</li>
<li>A major technical hurdle overcome was the iPadOS restriction on running multiple processes simultaneously. Unlike the desktop Godot editor, which launches a separate process for running a game, iPadOS does not allow a child process to run alongside the parent application.</li>
<li>To address this, the Xogot team had to &ldquo;virtualize&rdquo; Godot, modifying its core to allow multiple instances to run within a single application process. Early attempts involved manually resetting the entire Godot state when switching between the editor and running the game. A more robust solution was achieved by making Godot&rsquo;s root singleton thread-local storage and managing separate graphics contexts. This complex adaptation ensures the editor and the running game can coexist within the same application, enabling features like the integrated debugger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scripting Language Support (Limited to GDScript):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A significant limitation is that Xogot exclusively supports Godot&rsquo;s built-in scripting language, GDScript.</li>
<li>Compiled languages such as C#, C++, Swift, or Rust are <em>not</em> supported. The technical challenge here is substantial; supporting languages like Swift would require embedding the entire Swift compiler and toolchain within the app, which is not currently planned. Godot&rsquo;s recent transition from Mono to CoreCLR further complicates C# support specifically for the iOS platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GDExtension and Plugin Support (GDScript Only):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Related to scripting, Xogot only supports addons and plugins written purely in GDScript.</li>
<li>Compiled GDExtensions written in languages like C++ or C# are <em>not</em> supported. This limitation stems from Apple&rsquo;s App Store policies, which generally prohibit applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries for security reasons.</li>
<li>For popular GDExtensions to work in Xogot, they would need to be specifically ported to be multi-instance compatible and then potentially bundled directly within the Xogot application binary after careful consideration and porting efforts. Users have voiced interest in support for specific extensions like Godot-Jolt and Godot-Voxel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface Adaptation and Hybrid Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While Xogot is built on Godot, its user interface is heavily adapted for iPadOS to be touch-friendly, leading to differences compared to the desktop editor. This involves larger tappable regions, simplified layouts, and the use of SF Symbols instead of standard Godot icons in many places.</li>
<li>Not all parts of the UI have been rewritten in SwiftUI. High-traffic areas like the TileSet, TileMapLayer, Audio bus, and Shader editors are being rebuilt natively for a better touch experience. However, less frequently used components or third-party plugins may still display the original Godot UI, resulting in a sometimes inconsistent visual style.</li>
<li>Certain interactions common in desktop Godot may be missing or adapted. For example, tooltips are not available due to the lack of hover on touch devices. Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported with an external keyboard, but some desktop interactions like tabbing between inspector properties can be tricky to implement in the adapted UI. Users have also noted differences in behaviors like dragging objects accidentally triggering other editor windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Performance and Memory Constraints:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Memory usage is a key limitation on iPads, particularly for larger projects or on devices with less RAM. Users have reported low memory warnings and crashes, especially with projects that run many print statements or are generally asset-heavy.</li>
<li>There have been ongoing efforts to reduce memory consumption and fix leaks. Memory spiking when the app is sent to the background was identified as a cause of crashes.</li>
<li>While modern M-series chips on iPads offer significant processing power, available RAM appears to be a more critical factor for smooth performance in Xogot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Input Handling Specificities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xogot supports external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers, providing a familiar experience for desktop users.</li>
<li>A unique iOS-only feature is the built-in virtual controller, configurable in Project Settings. This maps to Xbox conventions and allows for testing games designed for controllers without implementing custom touch controls. However, it offers less customization than using a GDScript-based virtual joystick addon.</li>
<li>Handling multi-touch input in both the editor and running games has presented challenges, with bugs reported regarding simultaneous touch events and the distinction between raw touches and pan/magnification gestures. The input system has been modified and is not the same as vanilla Godot, which impacts upstreaming fixes.</li>
<li>Apple Pencil support is present, allowing for fine detail work, but features like hover input may not be fully supported by Godot itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>File System Integration and Version Control Workflow:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xogot leverages the iPadOS Files App for project and asset import/export. This allows transferring projects via iCloud Drive, local storage (&ldquo;On My iPad&rdquo;), or connected external drives. Drag and drop is supported for assets.</li>
<li>While projects can be saved to external locations, direct integration with cloud storage like iCloud Drive required adopting complex asynchronous File IO APIs and was not initially fully supported for saving.</li>
<li>Xogot does <em>not</em> have built-in Git support. The recommended workflow involves using a separate native iOS Git client like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. This requires using features like cloning into the Xogot folder or adding the project folder as a linked repository. Some advanced Git features require a Pro unlock in Working Copy. Command-line Git can also be used via an iSH terminal with mounting the Xogot directory.</li>
<li>A potential pitfall when moving projects between desktop OSes (Windows/Mac, which are typically case-insensitive) and iPadOS (which is case-sensitive) is issues arising from inconsistent file or folder casing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exporting and Deployment Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Xogot supports exporting projects to WebAssembly for playtesting via a hosted link. This feature hosts the build on <code>share.xogot.com</code> for a limited time.</li>
<li>Exporting to other platforms (such as native iOS apps, Android, Windows, etc.) must be done using the desktop version of Godot. The process for building a native iOS app from a Godot project requires a macOS machine, Xcode, export templates, and an Apple Developer account. Direct native iOS app building/deployment from Xogot is not a current feature, although it is a desired capability. The &ldquo;Export&rdquo; option in Xogot currently initiates iOS and WebAssembly exports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Device and OS Version Requirements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xogot requires iPadOS 18.0 or later and an iPad with an A12 Bionic chip or newer. This is due to reliance on APIs introduced in iOS/iPadOS 17 and extensively in 18.</li>
<li>Older iPadOS versions are not supported.</li>
<li>While the app can be installed and partially used on iPhones running iOS 18, the UI is not optimized for smaller screens, and some features may not work correctly.</li>
<li>It runs on VisionPro as the iPad app, not a dedicated build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These technical considerations mean that while Xogot offers a powerful Godot development experience on the iPad, it functions best as part of a larger workflow that may still require a desktop machine for tasks like building final native apps or utilizing plugins written in compiled languages. The ongoing development is actively addressing many of these points, particularly around UI native-ness and core editor functionality adapted for touch and memory constraints.</p>
<p>Considering these points, a potential next step for analysis could be to delve into how these specific technical limitations translate into workflow friction for different user segments (e.g., hobbyists, professional indies, developers building plugins or using advanced features) and identify which limitations are most critical for improving the value proposition of Xogot as a standalone development environment.</p>
<h3 id="version-control-and-collaboration-note">Version Control and Collaboration Note</h3>
<p>As your paid consultant and thought partner, let&rsquo;s delve into how Xogot approaches version control and collaboration for Godot projects, drawing upon the information available in the sources you&rsquo;ve provided. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for assessing workflow efficiency and scalability, which can inform strategic recommendations.</p>
<p>Xogot enables version control and collaboration for Godot projects primarily by leveraging the native file management capabilities of iPadOS and recommending the use of external, dedicated applications for Git integration. It does not feature a built-in Git client within the application itself, a decision influenced by the technical constraints and platform policies of iPadOS.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how this is facilitated and the considerations involved:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leveraging iPadOS Files App Integration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The foundation of Xogot&rsquo;s approach lies in its deep integration with the iPadOS Files App. This allows users to store their Godot projects and assets in locations accessible by other apps on the iPad, such as iCloud Drive, &ldquo;On My iPad&rdquo; storage, or connected external drives.</li>
<li>This integration means that the actual project files (<code>.godot</code> folder, <code>.tscn</code>, <code>.gd</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.) reside within the standard iPadOS file system, making them visible and manageable by any application that can interact with files in those locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Method: External Git Clients (Specifically Working Copy):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Because Xogot itself does not include Git functionality, the recommended workflow for version control involves using a separate, native iOS Git client. Working Copy is explicitly endorsed and recommended for this purpose.</li>
<li>Working Copy integrates seamlessly with the Files App, allowing it to access and manage the project files stored in the Xogot folder or other locations accessible via Files.</li>
<li>To use Working Copy with a Xogot project, users can either clone a Git repository directly into the Xogot folder using Working Copy, or add an existing Xogot project folder as a &ldquo;Linked Repository&rdquo; within Working Copy.</li>
<li>This enables users to perform standard Git operations – such as committing changes, pushing to and fetching from remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab), branching, etc. – using the Working Copy interface. Xogot automatically reflects file changes made by Working Copy due to the Files App integration.</li>
<li>It is noted that certain advanced features in Working Copy, like pushing changes and using linked folders, may require a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; unlock.</li>
<li>Users have confirmed that they successfully use this workflow with services like GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Method: Command-Line Git via iSH:</strong>
<ul>
<li>For users who are comfortable with command-line interfaces, the documentation also suggests using iSH, a Linux shell emulator for iPadOS, to manage Git repositories.</li>
<li>This involves installing Git within iSH, mounting the Xogot project directory to the iSH file system, and then running standard Git commands from the iSH terminal within that mounted directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning for No Built-in Git:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decision not to include a built-in Git client or support traditional Godot Git plugins stems from the architectural limitations and security policies of iPadOS and the Apple App Store.</li>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s policies generally restrict applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries or executing arbitrary code from outside the app&rsquo;s sandbox. This makes it technically challenging, if not impossible under standard App Store distribution, to bundle and run a generic Git client library or Godot&rsquo;s desktop-style Git plugin within the Xogot app.</li>
<li>Additionally, the core changes made to Godot to run within a single process on iPadOS, allowing the editor and game to coexist (&ldquo;virtualizing&rdquo; Godot), likely impact how tightly integrated external tools like Git plugins could be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Collaboration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This file-system-based approach, combined with external Git clients, directly supports collaborative workflows. Teams can store their Godot project in a shared Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).</li>
<li>Developers using Xogot on their iPads can pull the latest changes from the repository, work on the project locally using Xogot, and then commit and push their changes back to the shared repository using their Git client (like Working Copy).</li>
<li>This allows multiple team members, whether they are using Xogot on iPad or desktop Godot on Windows, macOS, or Linux, to contribute to the same project. Projects created in Xogot are compatible with desktop Godot and vice versa.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Share Your Work&rdquo; feature, which exports projects to WebAssembly for easy playtesting via a hosted link, also facilitates a form of collaboration by enabling rapid feedback loops on playable builds, although it&rsquo;s not direct code collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No In-Editor Git UI:</strong> A significant limitation compared to desktop IDEs or the standard Godot editor with a Git plugin is the lack of a fully integrated Git user interface within Xogot itself. Users must switch to a separate app (Working Copy or iSH) to perform version control operations.</li>
<li><strong>Case Sensitivity:</strong> A potential pitfall when collaborating on projects stored in Git and shared between desktop operating systems (like Windows or macOS, often case-insensitive file systems) and iPadOS (a case-sensitive file system) is that inconsistent casing in file or folder names can lead to issues or errors when opening or running the project on iPadOS. Users have reported encountering errors related to this when importing projects.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Friction:</strong> The necessity of using external apps adds steps to the development workflow compared to environments with integrated Git.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, Xogot enables version control and collaboration by relying on standard iPadOS file management and external Git applications. While it lacks built-in Git features due to platform constraints, this approach facilitates interoperability with desktop Godot workflows and allows teams to use established Git-based collaboration models.</p>
<p>A potential next step in analysis could be to evaluate the degree of workflow friction introduced by this external Git dependency for typical Godot development tasks (e.g., committing frequently, resolving merge conflicts) and how this might impact the appeal of Xogot as a primary development environment compared to a supplementary one for on-the-go work.</p>

			 <p>So my late stepfather, Gary, he&rsquo;s been dead for 12 years. Late doesn&rsquo;t really sound. But, um. he was the first and only person I&rsquo;ve ever seen to diligently maintain and insist others maintain the practices of in one&rsquo;s cell phone contacts, the people who should be contacted in case of emergency, whatever that might be, to prepend the acronym ICE, capital ICE, in case of emergency, I. Um. And this should be a long forgotten thing. Uh. But due to the magic of the way that Apple services work.. I, for an extended period of time, but not very often, so like, very intermittently, maybe, like, once every 18 months on average. I think it happened twice, two or three times.. I don&rsquo;t remember why my contacts were synced with Gary&rsquo;s. That is going back too far. But for whatever reason we had, shared contacts, I don&rsquo;t know if that was the practice, back then. Um. But.. I swear to you, uh, for some unknown reason without provocation that I could ever figure out, my iCloud contacts, uh, would change back to having the fucking ice acronym in the beginning, which, as you can probably imagine,. Um, in any sort of modern contact system, just really fucks things up. Uh It&rsquo;s very cute and earnest because if anything, for like the sheer amount of contacts that he. did that for, like, uh. all of his stepchildren, and by stepchildren, I don&rsquo;t even know what the term is. He married. Yeah, I guess it is stepchildren. Adult, stepchildren. It was more than ten. More than 10 contacts had ice the beginning. And. Um. You know, now I think you can designate one emergency contact, I think.. on iOS now. But, um.. Yeah, I guess here&rsquo;s the.. It&rsquo;s just funny. That&rsquo;s the whole story. I. There are a lot of things I feel like, generally, if you wanted to know um. My selfish lament regarding my stepfather&rsquo;s death, the most self centered one, is that, like.. I was a very like, tolerant kid and stuff and found him very amusing when a lot of people found him really irritating. But like,. I was almost to the age, almost there, where I would have really started to appreciate, all of his particular eccentricities to go on about that, but&hellip; And one of the things, like, you know, basically at what I&rsquo;m trying to say is,.. regardless of what caused it,, the few times that that happened were somehow really nice, like being haunted by fucking., like the way that you discover such a thing, by the way, is like you&rsquo;re I&rsquo;m searching for a contact in a search bar that I, you know, like my sister and I don&rsquo;t see it. Like, it doesn&rsquo;t appear. Searching for, uh, you know, Amy. It&rsquo;s not on the fucking list. Uh. And then you go through the whole thing and see that, actually acronym. But yeah, Being Haunted by Gary&rsquo;s.. You know, I&rsquo;ve never looked it up. I&rsquo;m not going to, actually. I hope it&rsquo;s just something that he did.</p>

<p><em>Note: I did not play a single frame of this game and uninstalled it immediately upon realizing that it (at least as yet) does not have controller support.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been eagerly anticipating the idea of this game <em>only the second ever</em> flavor of first person shooter (after the CoDs) to the iOS/iPadOS platform for how many years now? Legitimately, I remember being a younger person when I first &ldquo;preordered&rdquo; the app download. If disappointment wasn&rsquo;t such a hallmark of using life on said platforms throughout their whole history, the fact that <em>Delta Force</em> was published with zero(?) controller support whatsoever would be genuinely offensive.</p>
<p>Especially in this title&rsquo;s case, what confuses me most is&hellip; I can&rsquo;t figure out why you&rsquo;d bother publishing it at all on iOS/iPadOS - and we all know it can be <em>some bother</em> if you knew it&rsquo;d be touch-only.</p>

<p>Each of these playlist drafts is mostly skeletal, consisting of what curators call a “hypothesis,” or basic premise and intended target audience (the more specific, the better), and a few representative songs. In developing them, Colomo will flesh out the playlists with more songs (Spotify’s magic number is 50 — generally between 3 and 3.5 hours' worth — which feels substantial but not overwhelming), a cover image that reflects the hypothesis at a glance, and a short written description, usually no more than one or two sentences...</p><p>Hypotheses, of course, are meant to be tested, and Spotify curators regularly make adjustments to playlists based on data that shows how people are actually interacting with them.</p>

<h2 id="everything-but-the-physics">Everything but the physics.</h2>
<p>As a 15-year veteran of what one might describe as realism-aiming racing simulation experiences on this platform (and Apple One subscriber/longtime Arcade hopeful,) I remember being absolutely thrilled at first sight of this title&rsquo;s Store page. I&rsquo;d been waiting since the deprecation of Real Racing 2 for a truly timeworthy experience, so the idea of a freshly developed, racing-focused, controller-supporting sim delivered via the Arcade (and thus with less microtransaction-adjacent shenanigans) initially sounded very promising. More thrilling, too, was the initial ride through the user interface, where it was obvious that its feel was far from an afterthought.</p>
<p>Nearly everything about <em>Stradale</em>, in fact, is quite gorgeous. The car models awe and the original circuit designs intrigue. Unfortunately, it is all let down by <strong>the physics engine</strong>. It&rsquo;s difficult to chastise, here, compared to any other racing sim options on iOS/iPadOS. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/real-racing-3-car-race-game/id556164008" title="Real Racing 3 on the App Store"><em>Real Racing 3</em></a> technically supports controllers in that they will respond and control the game, yes, but it&rsquo;s such an afterthought, there, that they couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to implement any configurable settings (or even a <em>menu</em>/<em>submenu</em> for said settings, even.) <em>art of rally</em>&rsquo;s controller &ldquo;support&rdquo; is a similar story.</p>
<p><em>Stradale</em>, then, remains the first/only racing sim on this platform with responsive controller support <em>throughout</em> the majority of views within the application. It&rsquo;s also the first to have a default configuration (for my Xbox One controller, at least) that actually makes sense.</p>
<p>As difficult as it is to criticize it, then, it is even moreso to articulate why the physics of driving is enough of a miss to keep one from investing any time in this title. Comparing the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the driving to another, less-and-less compromised racing sim iPad experience - Gran Turismo 2 emulated in Provenance - the 25-year-old title&rsquo;s satisfying-as-heck &ldquo;feel&rdquo; manages to come through, despite all the obstacles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that <em>Stradale</em> can&rsquo;t be challenging. I fear it is something far more difficult (from what I know about game development) to remedy: there is something very essential missing from the driving experience that prevents the player from connecting, if you will, in a way that lends to the essential satisfaction one seeks from such a thing.</p>

<h2 id="long-awaited-elegantly-executed">Long-Awaited, Elegantly-Executed</h2>
<p>Somehow, this 1.4 MB, virtually inconfigurable, single-use application manages to be one of the most powerful audio manipulation tools on iOS. Those who remember maintaining a GarageBand install <em>just because they occasionally needed to trim audio files</em> will celebrate. One of very few apps I’ve come across that I absolutely wouldn’t change at all but would pay much more for.</p>
<p>Extraordinarily accurate (especially compared to <em>any</em> of its “competition”) and astonishingly robust.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-for-those-who-actually-frame">THE solution for those who actually frame</h2>
<p>As his co-editor notes in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/shareshot-1-0-pixel-perfect-screenshots-beautifully-presented">MacStories' review of Version 1.0</a>, Federico Viticci&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/#apple-frames">Apple Frames Shortcut</a> does indeed overlap in functionality with Shareshot, technically, but - more importantly, from my perspective - the two stand together high above any other mockup creation solution (for any platform).</p>
<p>At first, I was disappointed when I tried to use Shareshot&rsquo;s initial release version. <em>Boy, this could sure use some keyboard shortcuts</em>, I thought, along with <em>there&rsquo;s no way this system of &lsquo;choosing&rsquo; (not choosing) frame sizes isn&rsquo;t irritating every single user of this app</em>. I assumed - as I do with the vast majority of new software I try these days - that Shareshot&rsquo;s creators must not actually be using the app, that it wasn&rsquo;t actually supposed to be used, really, but was published, instead, for some economically-motivated reason I&rsquo;d never understand.</p>
<p>Very shortly after, however, <em>the most</em> extraordinarily encouraging thing(s) happened: in the span of just a single season, <em>all</em> of the issues/&ldquo;missing&rdquo; features I was sure anyone using the app extensively would immediately encounter were addressed with solid, well-documented updates.(Tee ell dee are: it is very obvious that Marc and Mark use the app themselves, are very competent, and value customer feedback.)</p>
<p>As I write this using Version 1.2.1 at the tail end of 2024, Shareshot is the perfect, built-for-me mockup application I have always dreamed of, assuming I&rsquo;d never get anything close.</p>

<h3 id="anecdotally">Anecdotally&hellip;</h3>
<p>An opportunity to compare transcript generation between <a href="https://davidblue.blog/transcripts/2024/12/15/1729.html">Microblog</a>&rsquo;s and the &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; transcripts now available in Voice Memos:</p>
<p>I guess it must have been um in 2021. I don&rsquo;t know why it feels like it was so long ago uh when I first heard about well, not, but I first heard of Of course the the name blues sky had been tossed around for a long time. That&rsquo;s why I had heard about it. uh The first time anything that I ever saw anything tangible, it was a discordite, of course, and what I did was that I immediately went in there and uh I think, well, the discussion that was happening that I remember it was about the protocol specifically. um and I literally just linked to activity to the main activity pub site. I think I linked to activity pub. rocks uh, and and it was just like, you guys know about this, right? Um, and I swear to you, like, uh and it was kind of like frantic. It was like sincere like wait, hang on a second because that&rsquo;s the way that that uh activity pub shit. um the actual foundation of to centralized social that&rsquo;s been around for um I was going to say decades. I guess it&rsquo;s probably pushing it a little bit, but a decade and more. um It&rsquo;s been developed on and refined to a point where it is like it is the thing. The technology, like is a and I guess I should appreciate that more. I guess the technology had already been established and from my perspective, it continues to be I mean the dream of social media seeing the first time I said this before a million times, but like seeing a pixel fed post in line on a masted on feed I remember that that thought like holy shit, this is literally what I wished for all along. um like shit. I wish that like the the technology barrier that um proprietary barriers between me and and whatever I wanted to express in the service, I wish that I could um barriers maybe not the right word, but actually is just like the dream. And like I don&rsquo;t know anything technically about the AT protocol because I am not like enough anything that&rsquo;s kind of intentional. I just don&rsquo;t have ruin my brain, but, you know, all these years, what I&rsquo;ve heard from people again about their hesitants, so mast it on their their bad experiences on mastodon have been because it was difficult. uh but like seeing some of those same people um literally have their username, their bluesray username stop resolving for a second. uh But I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t understand. And I guess it it&rsquo;s just and it just fucking sends me and I don&rsquo;t know why. I don&rsquo;t know why. um but redundancy, I guess, is just really alarming and also I don&rsquo;t know. um I heard a friend got their account their blue sky account suspended uh and I didn&rsquo;t follow up with him so I probably should actually the other day, but it seemed like he that that happened without explanation um and uh there&rsquo;s just no meaning behind calling yourself open source and if if that sort of thing is going to happen um also like practically speaking, if decentralization is what anyone in the in the blue sky project genuinely want it I still have yet to hear an explanation as for why they wouldn&rsquo;t have there just is none there is none other than money and the difference between m Macedon and blue sky is that blue sky took ventures money. uh and it&rsquo;s just strange to me and irritating a hell to hear um I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know anything about Jake Raber, but uh, like hearing her go on about uh the things they&rsquo;re doing in a meive Patel interview that he did recently. um and he just I love Neai. But like once again, that was I mean, and and decoder is his business podcast. So like I can&rsquo;t even like that&rsquo;s is very explicitly about business. uh so and organs or whatever. um so I guess I can&rsquo;t but like you got to interrupt her. Anyway, so okay, so what happened with that disord thing? I went in there, uh linked activity pub dot rocks and was like, guys, you know about this, right? Like woo, hold on. wait a second. uh and then like the response was I mean, I remember it being I didn&rsquo;t read it because it began with you know, the essence was uh well, but and I was just like, yeah, I got Bill, thank you to everyone who created activity problem. And I&rsquo;m like not it is not loyalty for the sake of I just really love the brand um because I it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t understand um and I and I suspect once again that literally your only barrier, I guess I should just be more explicit about it. Those of you who um found herself migrating this blue sky. Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna exempt anyone who has to do social media, for their livelihood, okay? Because that just doesn&rsquo;t count, then you have to go with other people. There are people. That has to be that&rsquo;s a whole different consideration. But like uh like you definitely what you mean by it&rsquo;s it was hard is that it&rsquo;s genuinely nonprofit and you get the same sickness that I suppose still have um but like damn uh it&rsquo;s so disappointing. and uh isolating, I guess. And frustrating, but, um yeah. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s gonna grow great. Um</p>

features like Screen Time will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of <em>reduced usage</em> you may have. If you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you <em>have</em>, Screen Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone so much, *<strong>stop* using the fucking phone</strong>. If you are truly concerned about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week/month/quarter – however long you <em>possibly</em> can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without getting fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have <em>truly</em> reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear picture of how it's changed you.

<ul>
<li>I grew up on a farm until I was 14 where fiddling with small engines (which I never got tired of and realized I&rsquo;ve missed quite a lot thanks to this experience) and interacting with centrifugal clutches (one of those things that sounds really neat in theory but just leaves you wanting for - and suffering without - basically any of the other options lol)</li>
<li>Adjacent to go karts but somehow still haven&rsquo;t got the opportunity to actually figure out to Do The Thing - always wondered. Kinda same thing with pouring concrete. Watching you poke your way through both for the first time felt like a real luxury haha.</li>
<li>Been watching Sarah&rsquo;s build videos for a year or so now, always absolutely flabbergasted at the diligence&hellip; the persistence&hellip; the intelligence&hellip; all the while doing like 5 full time people&rsquo;s jobs in video production, with much reverence but zero <em>resonance</em> with my own bumpkin ass behavior in similar pursuits. Curious because getting to capital R Relate with her and y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s troubleshooting here does have value, turns out.</li>

<p>There's a tedious way to do it, but it worked for me:</p>
<p>•Open the podcast using the Apple Podcast app (I used an iPhone with the latest iOS, didn’t try earlier versions or desktop app)</p>
<p>•Play the podcast and click the circle with three dots inside it, select “View Transcript”</p>
<p>•Now the entire transcript displays on your iPhone. Select and copy a large chunk of text. It has a limit of how much it copies, so just select a random larger amount after you get an idea how much text it copies.</p>
<p>•Open the Notes app and make a new note. Paste the copied text into the note</p>
<p>•Since it won’t copy everything you selected it will paste to its limit and add some characters at the end and copyright info from the podcast.&nbsp; Delete this text back to the actual content then go back to the podcast transcript and copy the next section and do the process again.</p>
<p>•Tips to make it go faster:</p>
<p>•It is easier to edit the Note on the desktop Notes app…after pasting it syncs in about 5 seconds, and you can just select and delete what you don’t want. This then syncs back to your iPhone Notes app by the time you are ready to paste the next section.</p>
<p>•In the podcast app when looking for the next section I needed, I used the search function to find my place in the transcript. Look for a unique word near the end of the previous section to dial it in the part you need.</p>
<p>Like I said, tedious and time consuming but it worked for me.</p>

<p>Having just experienced the text selection limitation myself, I am actually and absolutely offended by this.</p>
<p>Apple, Inc. - wealthiest company in the history of the world, often celebrated for their pro-accessibility effort in consumer technology - went through the trouble of developing and implementing an <em>intentional limitation</em> like this.</p>
<p>What the fuck do you think I&rsquo;m going to do&hellip; <em>sell</em> your auto-generated transcription???</p>

<h2 id="what-todays-tech-journalism-must-learn-again-from-the-legendary-computer-publication">What today’s tech journalism must learn again from the legendary computer publication.</h2>
<p><em>This is a very much unfinished bit I began writing in November 2020 and just found <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Remembering-Byte-Magazine--CabDxBJFzhqpwdw8_M3T6cmeAQ-MYdflii9EX929lJbCI8Yn">in my Dropbox Paper archive</a>.</em></p>
<p>Long-dead <em>BYTE Magazine</em> gained some exposure this time last year when some of its gorgeous retro-futurist cover art - of Robert Tinney’s hand - circulated about <a href="http://70sscifiart.tumblr.com/post/160419626518/cover-of-byte-1981-by-bob-tinney">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jaxter0ne/byte-magazine/">Pinterest</a>. It <em>is</em> fucking beautiful, yes, but I was then quite disappointed to find little in the way of the publication’s actual content available on the web.</p>
<p>Last week, I was elated to find <a href="http://bit.ly/bytemag">this exceptional archive on archive.org</a> with its exceptionally-scanned, ultra-high res PDFs of <em>every issue</em>, created by the archivist <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles">Jason Scott</a>. The notables of its legacy are fairly <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine&amp;tab=about">well-documented</a> - and it’s still occasionally cited by the likes of <a href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/03/the-personal-cloud/"><em>Wired</em></a> and <a href="http://time.com/60505/this-1981-computer-magazine-cover-explains-why-were-so-bad-at-tech-predictions/"><em>TIME</em></a>, but its story and mission have been ashamedly disregarded as infeasible relics; the naivete of the originator.</p>
<p>In Vol. 1, Issue 1 for September 1975, Carl Helmers’ first editorial - “<a href="http://extratone.com/library/whatisbyte-carlhelmers.pdf">What is BYTE?</a>” - is a charming introduction, full of techno-idealism and the quaint jargon of the then-obscure computing niche. <em>The Home Brew Computing Triology</em> is an ingenius summation of the technological conversation: <strong>HARDWARE, SOFTWARE,</strong> and <strong>APPLICATIONS</strong> - the “interrelated themes.” Helmers notes that the publication was founded to bridge the divide between the respective hardware and software cultures and get them talking about <em>applications.</em> Later in the issue, publisher Wayne Green <a href="http://extratone.com/library/howbytestarted-waynegreen.pdf">explains</a> how his encounters with the community amidst a journey to modernize <em>73</em> - his amateur radio magazine - led to this prompt.</p>
<p>“I discovered an interesting thing - few of the hardware chaps could talk software - and vice versa.”</p>
<p>A sensical and exciting pitch, to be sure, but disappointing when one considers the remaining vastness of this gulf over 40 years later. The successors to <em>BYTE</em> - when compared to any of its trade magazine contemporaries - aren’t <em>technology news</em> at all. Mastheads like <em>The Verge</em>, <em>Engadget</em>, and <em>CNET</em> have become something else, entirely in the pursuit of the <em>end user</em> click, and a good lot of them simply <em>look like shit</em>. Reading up on tech hasn’t been a respectful or aesthetically-pleasant endeavor for as long as I’ve been literate, and <em>BYTE</em>’s experience would suggest that it’s been without much worthy cause, whatsoever.</p>
<p><a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/7902/byte-magazine-covers-1976-84">Typographically</a>, its pages are a bit dense, but it’s in an otherworldy mysticism regarding the pioneers of digital that one longs to reanimate, somehow.</p>

<p>Please feel free to <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf">rebuke the fuck outta me</a>, but no&hellip; I&rsquo;m 30 years old and still have yet to make it through a single one of those awesome list tutorials for Python that are so easy peasy for you digital lourds.</p>
<p>In what I imagine to be the manifestation of many a folk&rsquo;s worst nightmare LLM scenario, I asked regular olé free Gee Pee Tee to help me do something I&rsquo;ve aspired to do (though invested little effort in, obviously:) creating my first command line application, and found it to be immediately effective! Within the minutes that spanned the conversation below - following the heinous monstrosity&rsquo;s instructions almost verbatim - I had actually published <a href="https://pypi.org/project/davodtime/">my first PyPi package</a>!</p>
<p><code>pip install davodtime</code></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Please note: the following is a conversation with an LLM.</em></p>

<p>Please help me create a command line application (ideally, using a programming language/platform which will be supported on both my macOS-running machine and within the a-Shell app on my iPad) which returns outputs based on arguments I will specify.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT:</h4>
<p>To create a cross-platform command line application that works on both macOS and within the a-Shell app on your iPad, I recommend using Python. Python is a versatile and widely supported language that runs on both platforms without much modification.</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
<h4 id="1-setup-python">1. <strong>Setup Python</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>macOS:</strong> Python 3 is typically pre-installed. You can check the installation by running:

</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="you-1">You:</h4>
<p>I would like the application to be called davodtime and would ideally like to be able to install it so that I can simply call it with &ldquo;davodtime.&rdquo; Here are the functions and arguments I&rsquo;d like it to perform:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Input: <code>davodtime utc</code> returns the current UTC time in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss in the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input: <code>davodtiime</code> (no arguments) defaults to returning the local system time in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip;and so on, with GMT and standard abbreviations for timezones supported as arguments.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-1">ChatGPT:</h4>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can create the <code>davodtime</code> command line application using Python. This application will support the functionality you&rsquo;ve described, and it will work on both macOS and within the a-Shell app on your iPad.</p>

</code></pre><h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With this Ruby version, you now have the same <code>davodtime</code> functionality as the Python version. The Ruby script is capable of handling timezones, UTC, and default local time, along with <code>-h</code> and <code>--help</code> arguments. You can also generate the same man page and distribute the tool similarly on both macOS and a-Shell.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any more information!</p>
<h4 id="you-6">You:</h4>
<p>Would it be possible to do this without any dependencies?</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-6">ChatGPT:</h4>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s possible to create the <code>davodtime</code> tool in Ruby without using external dependencies like <code>tzinfo</code>. Ruby’s built-in <code>Time</code> and <code>DateTime</code> classes already handle UTC and local time well. However, for time zones, Ruby doesn’t have direct support for converting between named timezones like &ldquo;PST&rdquo; or &ldquo;EST&rdquo; without a library like <code>tzinfo</code>.</p>
<p>You can still implement the core functionality using built-in Ruby classes by limiting the time zone support to a few common ones (like UTC, GMT, PST, EST) and hardcoding their offsets. This way, there won’t be any dependencies, and you can still have basic timezone support.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>format_time(time)</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This function formats a <code>Time</code> object into the <code>MMddYYYY-HHmmss</code> format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardcoded Timezone Offsets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using a library to get timezones, we manually calculate the time offsets for some common timezones (<code>PST</code>, <code>EST</code>, <code>GMT</code>, <code>CST</code>, <code>MST</code>). For example, <code>PST</code> is <code>UTC-8</code>, so we subtract 8 hours (in seconds) from UTC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timezone Support</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script now supports the following timezones:
<ul>
<li><code>UTC</code>: Coordinated Universal Time (no offset)</li>
<li><code>GMT</code>: Same as UTC</li>
<li><code>PST</code>: Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)</li>
<li><code>EST</code>: Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5)</li>
<li><code>CST</code>: Central Standard Time (UTC-6)</li>
<li><code>MST</code>: Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can easily extend this by adding more timezones with their appropriate offsets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help Message</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>print_help</code> function prints the usage information, explaining how to use the tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main Logic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no arguments are provided, the script returns the local system time.</li>
<li>If <code>utc</code> is passed, it returns the current UTC time.</li>
<li>If a timezone (e.g., <code>PST</code>, <code>EST</code>) is passed, it calculates and displays the time for that timezone.</li>
<li>If <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> is passed, it displays the help message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="running-the-tool">Running the Tool</h3>
<p>You can now run this script in the same way as the previous versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Time</strong> (no arguments):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">davodtime

davodtime --help
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="timezone-extension">Timezone Extension</h3>
<p>You can extend this to support more timezones by adding more cases to the <code>get_time_for_timezone</code> function. Just look up the correct UTC offset for the timezone you want to support, and apply it similarly to how the script currently handles <code>PST</code> and <code>EST</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to add <code>IST</code> (Indian Standard Time, UTC+5:30):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#66d9ef">when</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IST&#39;</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This Ruby version of <code>davodtime</code> now works without any external dependencies and still provides basic timezone support for common zones. It’s lightweight and works well on both macOS and a-Shell without needing to install any libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Collins:</strong> &hellip;I just want to walk through their daily process for writing headlines. They come in every day. There’s either one or two meetings depending on the day, and then they write — usually, it’s around 190 headlines. They are put into a Google form and completely anonymized. Then, from there, it’s trimmed down a little bit by one of the editors per day. Then, they go in the room, and they read them out loud, all of them, and if it gets a laugh or if it’s like that’s something that’s a character we’re going to bring back or they got to talk through it, they check it off, and then they whittle those down over and over and over again. And by the end of the meeting, there’s usually — what, Danielle? — like 10 max, 5 to 10?</p>
<p><strong>Danielle Strle:</strong> Yeah, tops.</p>
<p><strong>BC:</strong> Around there. And then, those get written out, and if the copy’s not good or if it’s just a nib or something, that gets whittled down to three or four per day. And that comes from that contributor network that has legit famous people in it, or it comes from the people in the room. And then only after all that did they go back, and they’re like, “That guy wrote that thing.” That’s how meritocratic this is.</p>

<p>All right folks, it&rsquo;s your favorite thing, favorite time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to play around with the changes to audio capture specifically, an iPadOS 18.1 beta 2.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually, I don&rsquo;t know if this is as a beta 2.</p>
<p>Two things I noticed, the thing that they introduced in 16 I believe, which is called mic modes, where you could switch between standard wide spectrum and voice isolation.</p>
<p>I say you could switch.</p>
<p>This was in control center, it&rsquo;s still in control center, they redesigned where it is, and the interface is very pretty, but they didn&rsquo;t fucking fix it, and by fix that I just mean have it, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s an API thing I guess.</p>
<p>I really just need to put on a list of things that I go down and make a mock-up fucking app so that I can see what the actual control is, the actual fucking backend code.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m capable of this, or at least it doesn&rsquo;t come easily, because um, in order to switch mic modes, and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m recording in voice isolation or standard or wide spectrum right now, this is in voice memos, which is a native app which has transcription now, which is very cool, except even as I&rsquo;m recording right now I don&rsquo;t have access to that mic modes menu.</p>
<p>I had to start a live stream on Telegram.</p>
<p>Telegram, of course, is the one app that semi-reliably gives me access to the mic modes thing, but it still sticks as in you make a selection.</p>
<p>There was no selection at first.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is voice memos recording in lossless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if stereo voice memos is a new capability, but if you go to the app specific menu for voice memos in iPadOS 18, there was a toggle that was default off, just called stereo, and it&rsquo;s on now.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>All right, same device, same setting, but this is ferrite.</p>
<p>Ferrite being, well, the closest that we&rsquo;ve ever come, really, to a professional audio capture app on this device.</p>
<p>Um, let&rsquo;s see, do I have access to mic modes?</p>
<p>Nope, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Um, but uh, yeah, I, notably, one thing that ferrite recently added, and I know it&rsquo;s silly, but uh, when I was in high school growing up around musicians and audio stuff, uh, FLAC files were basically a fucking meme because, um, you know, I explored all the drywall stuff in FLAC, which is, which is, if you know what I&rsquo;m talking about, kind of funny.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can export it to FLAC now in ferrite.</p>
<p>And finally, recording in 96 kilohertz directly into Logic Pro for iPad.</p>
<p>Same microphone array, I think.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess it&rsquo;d be very weird if I had access to mic modes here.</p>
<p>But I, so I listened back to, um, at least the voice memos recording, uh, and I&rsquo;m almost positive that that was indeed in voice isolation.</p>
<p>Um, I guess the last subject would be, uh, I&rsquo;m gonna see if I can, I&rsquo;ll have a go at putting this together in fucking Logic Pro. Oh wait, actually, no, I&rsquo;ll put it in, I&rsquo;ll put it in ferrite and export it to WIP because WIP does 320 playback.</p>
<p>Uh, transcription.</p>
<p>I, um, think that on-device transcription is really cool, you know, native.</p>
<p>Uh, I would just like to mention that Cinder&rsquo;s sword, his sword, who&rsquo;s, wow, I actually know how to pronounce his name, but I&rsquo;m not going to continue to fail.</p>
<p>Uh, his app, ICO, which is free, A-I-K-O, um, at least for my recordings so far, it&rsquo;s just fucking better.</p>
<p>And you can import anything, video files.</p>
<p>Uh, I try to, the weirdest fucking file format, I think I did a WebM and it was fine and allows you to immediately copy, uh, and also export into all, uh, a bunch of different text formats and it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>And it is also on-device and it&rsquo;s bizarrely fast, but, uh, you know, I&rsquo;ve got the newest chips.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just buy a Shure SM57 and a Sema and a used, buy a used Shure SM57, uh, and a USB audio interface, a relatively good quality one.</p>
<p>Um, just do that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy an iPad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh was just behind a Tesla Model X for a moment and just long enough to notice that they I mean it looks like it I don&rsquo;t even know they put a SpaceX badge on the rear as in where the brand badge would be I don&rsquo;t actually remember if I don&rsquo;t think the word Tesla is there but uh I didn&rsquo;t get a long enough look at it to tell but uh it was square but very homemade looking and certainly it completely unrelated to SpaceX&rsquo;s actual branding and I just I don&rsquo;t use the word lame very often I don&rsquo;t know if that seems like it&rsquo;s kind of for a reason but that&rsquo;s just the lamest fucking thing that I&rsquo;ve seen in a good while and it&rsquo;s a shame that all that work I did tracking down the type typeface so that I could make a parody Tesla brand logo instead of saying Tesla says Musker literally no one has ever laughed at that I don&rsquo;t know why this is a you guys problem that&rsquo;s your problem man</p>

			 <p>Back in July, 2021, I posted <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685201">a thread</a> on the Apple Developer forums asking for clarification on the differences between hardware keyboard support on iPad and iPhone.</p>
<p>The response&hellip; blew my mind, suffice it to say, but I would like to take a moment to champion ChatGPT, of all fucking things, for its reply when <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/f71fa827-0a02-4273-9df4-c9d3ad3e1ec3"><strong>given the same request</strong></a> and asked to respond:</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thank you for your detailed question and the context provided. Your observations about the state of Bluetooth keyboard support and documentation for iPhones are insightful and highlight a gap in current resources.</p>
<h3 id="current-state-of-documentation-and-support">Current State of Documentation and Support</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Bluetooth Keyboard Support on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you&rsquo;ve noted, iPhones do support Bluetooth keyboards, and there is ongoing development in this area. However, the documentation has not kept pace with these developments, particularly since the split of iPadOS from iOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discrepancy in Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation for iPad keyboard shortcuts is comprehensive (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096">Learn iPad keyboard shortcuts</a>), but there is no equivalent for iPhones. The iPhone User Guide focuses primarily on basic setup and pairing (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/magic-keyboard-iph2ced3177/14.0/ios/14.0">iPhone Magic Keyboard pairing</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer Awareness</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your experience with developers unaware of their apps' Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts on iPhones indicates a need for better communication and documentation from Apple to bridge this knowledge gap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="answer-to-your-question">Answer to Your Question</h3>
<p><strong>Where can I find complete documentation of both keyboard shortcuts support in native apps/the OS and <code>UIKeyCommand</code>’s uniquely-iPhone considerations?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t a single comprehensive source that documents all the keyboard shortcuts supported on iPhones across native apps and the OS. However, here are some steps and resources that might help:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>UIKeyCommand Documentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeycommand">UIKeyCommand</a> class is the primary resource for developers to implement and understand keyboard shortcuts in their apps. While this documentation doesn&rsquo;t differentiate between iPhone and iPad, the principles apply to both.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s support pages on accessibility features can provide some insight into keyboard usage on iPhones, particularly for those who use keyboards for accessibility reasons. For example, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/full-keyboard-access-iph3e551b4c9/ios">Full Keyboard Access</a> is a feature available on both iPhones and iPads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer Forums and WWDC Sessions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging in Apple Developer Forums and watching relevant WWDC sessions can provide additional insights and updates. Sessions such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10120/">this one from WWDC 2021</a> cover many topics related to keyboard navigation and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendations-and-next-steps">Recommendations and Next Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback to Apple</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given your detailed observations and the gaps in documentation, I recommend submitting feedback to Apple through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">Feedback Assistant</a>. Your input could help prioritize better documentation and resources for iPhone keyboard support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Collaboration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider collaborating with other users and developers to compile a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for iPhones. This could be shared on platforms like GitHub or a dedicated website, providing a valuable resource for the community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Findings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have already documented some keyboard shortcuts through your testing, sharing these findings on forums or community platforms could benefit other users facing similar challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you again for your question and your efforts in highlighting this important issue. Your initiative is greatly appreciated, and I hope these suggestions help you find the information you need.</p>

<p>The URL you provided appears to be using <strong>percent encoding</strong> (also known as URL encoding).</p>
<p>In percent encoding, special characters are replaced with a percent sign (<code>%</code>) followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the ASCII code of the character. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space character (<code> </code>) is represented as <code>%20</code>.</li>
<li>The slash character (<code>/</code>) is represented as <code>%2F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the URL you provided, you can see encoded characters such as <code>%2F</code>, <code>%2C</code>, and <code>%3D</code>. This encoding is commonly used in URLs to ensure that all characters conform to the standard URL format and can be safely transmitted over the internet.</p>

<p>The decoded base64 string appears to be a structured data representation, possibly in a binary or protocol buffer format. Here&rsquo;s a partial interpretation of the decoded content:</p>

</code></pre><p>This suggests that the encoded data is a list of locations, likely with additional metadata such as coordinates or identifiers. However, there are non-printable characters and other binary data interspersed, which indicate this is not a straightforward text encoding but rather a structured format requiring specific decoding logic, likely a protobuf or similar serialization format.</p>

If you are someone who&#39;s actually like experienced the benefits of 5G I want to hear from you.

It cannot be that your bandwidth is just faster.

I&#39;m talking you did a robot surgery.

Like one of these things they told us would happen with 5G. I have one example for everyone.

I&#39;ll put it out there right now.

Last night I watched Taylor Swift announced 1989 Taylor&#39;s version from SoFi Stadium on like 45 different like crystal clear live streams on TikTok.

That is because NFL stadiums have millimeter wave 5G in.

That&#39;s why.

That&#39;s it.

That&#39;s the future.

Okay I&#39;ll give you that one.

I&#39;ve taken that one off the table.

They put so much bandwidth in NFL stadiums that I watched effectively pirate live streams of a Taylor Swift concert.

Okay that one&#39;s off the table.

Give me something else.

Email us VirgCastTheVirge.com.

I&#39;m dying to know if anyone has done like a robot 5G surgery, if they&#39;ve deployed a low latency application to a telecom company&#39;s edge data center.

You let me know because I haven&#39;t seen one other than these phones are slightly faster.

Does updating your laptop at a hotel count?

No that&#39;s just more bandwidth.

But it was really nice bandwidth.

You cannot give me you cannot give me I can pull down one gig speeds blah blah blah.

You have to give me something on the order of tens of thousands of people in an NFL stadium live streamed crystal clear video to the internet all at once right.

Not just you alone stood on a street corner with with high bandwidth.

Tens of thousands of people use the internet once to because of the Taylor Swift.

Like that is that and I give you that.

That is a meaningful 5G thing that you could not do with an LTE network.

But give me like one more.

Wait we did not do all of this for the eras tour.

At least I don&#39;t think we did.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was reminded yesterday - as I am very, <em>very</em> occasionally - about <a href="https://bilge.world/crossing-church-digital-worship"><strong>a <em>thing</em></strong></a> I blasted out on <em>The Psalms</em> in early August 2019 about my early childhood mobility from the traditional to the trendy, contemporary side of protestant Christianity. It&rsquo;s still one of my favorites, but I&rsquo;ve long since conceded that it&rsquo;s only of any interest/entertainment to a relatively narrow range of my peers, so please don&rsquo;t force yourself&hellip;</p>
<p>I <em>did</em>, however, find the ability of whatever LLM is powering Craft&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/8104602502557-About-Craft-AI-Assistant">AI Assistant</a>&rdquo; to comprehend (pretty much uniquely lol) and &hellip; proceed to falsify (when asked with its &ldquo;Continue Writing&rdquo; feature) an intriguing, if entirely reiterative, continuation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intersection between technology and faith is nothing new, and perhaps it is inevitable in an era where our connections to both our gods and our gadgets are increasingly mediated through screens and silicon. What is new, however, is the seamlessness with which these two realms have merged, and The Crossing embodies this synthesis to a near-parodic degree. The seamless integration of Apple’s design philosophy with ecclesiastical function speaks volumes about the state of modern worship. No longer are these spiritual gatherings confined to the quaint confines of rustic chapels; today, they are multi-sensory experiences designed for optimal engagement, just like any leading tech product rollout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s no hyperbole to suggest that Sunday morning services at The Crossing could double as master classes in brand management and user experience design. From the staged lighting and choreographed worship sessions to the polished presentations and strategically positioned merchandise (yes, they’ve got their own line of inspirational swag), every detail has been meticulously curated to amplify the message - or sell the product, depending on your perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As my teenage self begrudgingly shuffled into the expansive auditorium, clutching my first-generation iPhone, I couldn&rsquo;t help but draw stark comparisons between the well-oiled machinery of The Crossing and the corporate monoliths we were being taught to admire. I watched as Pastor Dave - or was it Keith? They were nearly indistinguishable in their uniform of casual-business attire - delivered his message with the fervor of a seasoned CEO revealing quarterly earnings. The Sunday service was less about divine transcendence and more about slick performance, interwoven with all the trappings of modern corporate culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This observation delves deeper into the heart of what has become a glaring reality of modern American Christianity: the commercialization of faith. The lines between spiritual guidance and consumer satisfaction have blurred to the point where the two are now practically indistinguishable. Churches like The Crossing operate on a model that mirrors any successful enterprise: attract, engage, convert, and retain. Loyal congregation members are not unlike loyal customers, ensuring a steady stream of revenue—whether through donations, event tickets, or branded merchandise.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the glow of LED screens and under the hum of advanced AV systems, I found myself questioning not the existence of a higher power, but the mechanisms through which that power was being marketed to us. Was the message of love, redemption, and faith being overshadowed by the efficiencies and profit motives of a capitalist framework? The irony was not lost on me that a place—supposedly meant for transcending earthly desires—had become an exemplar of earthly success, complete with its own suite of digital tools and marketing tactics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as I distanced myself from The Crossing and its tech-savvy congregation, I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the lingering impact of its polished presentation. Each visit etched a deeper groove into my skeptical mind; each sermon reinforced the astounding adaptability of organized religion. It wasn’t hard to imagine a future where the sacred and the secular would become even more intertwined, blurring the lines until they were indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the spectacle of The Crossing was not just a reflection of faith’s evolving landscape but a broader commentary on the pervasive reach of corporate culture into every facet of our lives. In a world where even our spiritual journeys are mediated through technological interfaces and business models, the boundaries of the sacred and the profane continue to shift with each innovation. Whether this is a cause for celebration or concern depends largely on one’s perspective, but one thing is certain: the days of simplistic, unmediated worship are long behind us, replaced by a new paradigm that is as captivating as it is complex.</p>

			 <p>As the utter psychosis of adtech has come further and further into the mainstream light, I have been occasionally enjoying myself by &ldquo;leveraging&rdquo; GDPR-obliged services against the most virulent believers with which I&rsquo;ve had an account (so, all of them) in order to obtain just glimpses into the actual data of the mythos we&rsquo;ve all built about the shit.

<p>Some time in late Summer 2021, I stumbled into another of the handful of nigh-inconceivable conversation opportunities which Twitter Spaces would offer me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2019/10/05/how-marquis-trill-gained-millions-of-followers-and-what-he-can-teach-you-about-millennial-marketing">Marquis Trill</a> - someone I&rsquo;m still not <em>100%</em> convinced I actually remembered from the ~2012 Twitter Epoch - decided to just fuckin go on Spaces one day for the first time. And - as per the nature of Spaces - I guess I just hopped in the mf too.</p>
<p>Eventually in this recording, you&rsquo;ll hear me pipe in&hellip; and continue to intermittently throughout its duration. I remember being genuinely fascinated with the experience in the moment, but it&rsquo;s not exactly easy listening (shame) in retrospect lol.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the metadata from the Space I retained, though I doubt it will ever be actionable again:</p>

Yesterday morning, a friend&rsquo;s inquiry into the pursuit of owning a Jaguar like mine led me to realize this, and you would not believe how much time I spent spinning my wheels to get the original text from Paper to what [<strong>you can now experience on The Psalms</strong>](<a href="https://bilge.world/rock-springs-wyoming" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><a href="https://bilge.world/rock-springs-wyoming">https://bilge.world/rock-springs-wyoming</a></a>).

<p>I had the relatively unique experience of coming to Git, mobile-first, via this very application on my iPhone 8 Plus, almost exactly 4 years ago. Thanks to GitHub&rsquo;s Education program, I&rsquo;ve had access to unlimited repository creation since that first day, and it&rsquo;s honestly quite a testament to the power of Working Copy just how much of a mess I made in those initial few months.</p>
<p>Now on my iPad Pro, I keep so many repos (89 as of this writing) that I have <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a22e2d74ecb34230a6036230a836e9dd" title="WorkingCopyRepositoryTotIndex Siri Shortcut">an automation</a> that maintains a browsable index of the lot (which is, itself, a testament to Working Copy&rsquo;s incredibly comprehensive and solid Siri Shortcuts support.)</p>

<p>By far the most delightful compression/extraction utility for macOS (imo) is somewhat diminished in <em>delightfulness</em> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keka/id6443677513">its mobile form</a>, though not in its pure <em>functionality</em>. From the perspective of a year one iOS user with plenty of experience exploring what alternatives have been offered since the introduction of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider" title="File Provider Documentation">File Provider API</a> in iOS11, Keka for iOS/iPadOS' shear speed is distinct enough from its few platform competitors to warrant the title of Best such utility on the platform.</p>
<p>Also unique/notable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aonez/Keka" title="Keka's source code on GitHub">Open Source</a></li>

It also remains the only application permanently bound to a global keyboard shortcut (`⌥``) on my aging (Monterey-limited,) Intel MacBook Pro, and its interface continues to delight as much as it did on first call, who knows how many years ago.</p>

			 <p>Below is an excerpt from my just-republished <a href="https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review"><strong>2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review</strong></a> detailing my singular encounter with capital-r Road Rage in the entirety of my ~year driving for Uber/Lyft.</p>
<iframe src="https://whyp.it/tracks/embed?id=159428" width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<hr>
<p>My only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare driving occurred on All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve when I stopped - no more illegally than usual - on the opposite corner from a popular downtown Mexican restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights shining. The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 - the Atlas' competitor) just&hellip; stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of <em>what the fuck are you doing?</em> and such.</p>
<p>I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti&rsquo;s windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver&rsquo;s side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you&rsquo;d imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. <em>Uggs?</em></p>
<p>How positive are <em>you</em> that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously <em>much</em> more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busy one&hellip; except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was &ldquo;not <em>supposed</em>&rdquo; to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely <em>perturbed</em> this woman - that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage.</p>
<p>I inserted the next logical question which I&rsquo;d been screaming telepathically: <em>can you not get around me?</em> I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that <em>going around</em> as a concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting &ldquo;I could go around, but I don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket.&rdquo; Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit - nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we&rsquo;d simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or the Atlas.</p>
<p>Granted, to her I am still a <em>Young Man</em>, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone - even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: <em>she is in fact their servant</em>.) Her own folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such &ldquo;ugliness&rdquo; (if you will) is hard-headed, an ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged.</p>

You&rsquo;re welcome.</em></p>
<p>SO you want me to review <em>Champion&rsquo;s Online</em>, virtually unprompted, in 2024, eh?</p>
<p>Well, I loved and was very invested in Cryptic Studios at the time (see: <a href="https://bilge.world/star-trek-online"><em>Star Trek Online</em></a> and Champions was already regarded - in a very misty-eyed, not very practical sense - reverently as very much <em>their baby</em> by the time I arrived in 2009.</p>
<p>I think it was 2011 or so that I decided to commit to <em>Champions</em> - despite how thoroughly uninteresting and unintelligible I found the whole idea of comic book superheroes. In contemporary language, yes it was absolutely <em>super cringe</em>, but I remember admiring how well-established (in a very practical sense) the identity of this title was compared to the product they were building on the same platform with identical tooling that was <em>Star Trek Online</em> at the time.</p>

<p>So, with all of that out of the way, we can get to David Zipper, who is somebody that, as I said, we&rsquo;ve wanted to have David on the show for a long time.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with David from his writing at Bloomberg City Lab, where he relentlessly covers road safety, climate change, the future of micromobility, and the connections among public transit, municipal policy, and rideshare.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s take on all this is informed by his experience as someone who has worked inside city government, as well as in venture capital and as a startup advisor.</p>
<p>For several years, he&rsquo;s been visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School&rsquo;s Taubman Center for State and Local Government, where he examines the interplay between transportation policy, technology, and society.</p>
<p>David Zipper, welcome at last to the war on cars.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be here.</p>
<p>So we could talk with David about anything and everything, because he writes about everything that interests all of us.</p>
<p>But I wanted to start by asking about this package of TV segments that you were part of in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>A local NBC affiliate did a series of reports on road safety in the Dallas area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear a clip.</p>
<p>Crossley says the state has long designed roads to accommodate speeds much higher than the posted speed limit.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s called the design speed.</p>
<p>He says, TexDOT designs have often prioritized wider traffic lanes on massive freeway corridors and six lane state highways running through urban pedestrian neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Designed for moving traffic fast, he says, more than keeping speeds at the safest levels in congested areas.</p>
<p>At some point, you have to make a choice of whether it&rsquo;s more important to save lives or to facilitate fast car traffic.</p>
<p>So, David, maybe you could talk about how a city like Dallas balances those priorities, this trade off between speed and safety and what is wrong or right about the way they do that.</p>
<p>It was kind of an unexpected turn of events.</p>
<p>That whole project sort of started with randomly with an email in my inbox.</p>
<p>And it was from this NBC affiliate in Dallas that said, hey, we&rsquo;re trying to understand road safety.</p>
<p>Can we talk to you about it?</p>
<p>And when I spoke with the main investigator, I was excited because a lot of the time when you see crash coverage, and you guys know this, the crash coverage is focused on, you know, why are drivers so crazy or why are people not obeying the rules they should be following when they drive?</p>
<p>And from the beginning, I was intrigued because these investigators with NBC in Dallas want to understand why is their city the worst in the entire country around road safety?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re asking the right questions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking about road design.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking about vehicle design.</p>
<p>And I had a couple of calls with them.</p>
<p>I live in Washington, D.C. I&rsquo;d never actually been to Dallas.</p>
<p>I made very clear to them, I know nothing about your specific city, but I&rsquo;m happy to help if I can because I frankly never seen a really good video investigation in American News into American road safety that reaches a broad audience.</p>
<p>And they eventually flew me out and they drove, it was kind of funny, they drove me around Dallas and would bring me these like terrible roads like Buckner Avenue.</p>
<p>If anyone knows Dallas in the east, it&rsquo;s in a lower income, largely Latino neighborhood.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you know, it&rsquo;s just like the classic strode where you&rsquo;ve got a bus stop across the strode and people are like running across it because the nearest crosswalk is a half mile away.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, well, what do you think of this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>This is designed for danger.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what was going to come from it.</p>
<p>And it was a few weeks later that I saw the series that they put together, which I was so impressed by because they included not just a few snippets from myself.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just one of a bunch of people they included.</p>
<p>They went all the way to Edmonton, Canada, to look at how road safety could be done much better with sort of bulb outs and with much better leading pedestrian indicators and things like that.</p>
<p>And they also cornered the head of TxDOT and sort of grilled him about the 85th percentile rule and how he was using that or his agency uses that to set speed limits too high.</p>
<p>That to me was like such a great moment to see that style of journalism deployed that way.</p>
<p>But maybe you could also explain what the 85th percentile rule is and why it&rsquo;s such a messed up way to set speed limits.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the 85th percentile rule actually was like developed as a concept in the thirties.</p>
<p>And the idea there was to figure out how to set speed limits in rural areas, but it just sort of got stuck.</p>
<p>It ended up being plastered all over sort of state DOT policy rules for cities too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been a huge problem.</p>
<p>What the 85th percentile rule is to basically say, it&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, just go to a given street, record 100 speeds of drivers, and then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many crazies you have that are blowing past that street far faster than is safe for anybody not inside a vehicle, regardless, you just basically pick the 85th person out of a hundred and they set the speed limit for the entire street.</p>
<p>And that ends up basically making it very difficult to lower speed limits to speeds that are safer for particularly the road users or street users who are outside the vehicle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And the reporter confronted the head of tech dot on this.</p>
<p>Can you describe maybe a little bit of what happened there?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I myself wasn&rsquo;t there for this, but I did, I was asked about it in the studio and I said, I don&rsquo;t really understand how tech dot says they want to build safe streets, but they&rsquo;re literally lifting the speed limit and some major roads and highways in Dallas, which invariably will make those streets more and roads more dangerous.</p>
<p>And the reporters in friend BC had concluded speed was going to be sort of like the main topic or the main sort of like pillar of their argument for why Dallas streets are so dangerous.</p>
<p>And they wanted to talk to the tech dot director, tech stop being in the Texas Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>And he kept avoiding them.</p>
<p>The press office was just like putting up a wall.</p>
<p>So eventually the reporters just went ahead to a public meeting where text that was going to be speaking and they just confronted the director and they forced him to talk to him.</p>
<p>And they asked him about the 85th percentile and said, oh, we&rsquo;re moving away from that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not using that so much anymore.</p>
<p>And then the reporters to their credit investigated a bit and found text documents that clearly were using the 85th percentile to set the speed limit in Dallas.</p>
<p>So it was a bit of a gotcha moment that frankly, I enjoyed going to a hospital and asking them why they&rsquo;re still using leeches.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s this thing that was set in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And I think very similar to our Donald Shoop episode where he talks about minimum parking requirements of just like this thing that was set and nobody&rsquo;s ever really questioned.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sort of pseudoscience that still guides the design of our cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even crazier than leeches because it&rsquo;s like the drivers are doing something illegal and dangerous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re speeding and we&rsquo;re basically saying like, okay, you guys who are doing something illegal and dangerous get to sort of determine you set the pace, you set the pace, like we&rsquo;re going to base the whole system on the 85th percentile of this illegal thing you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so nonsensical.</p>
<p>But David, I&rsquo;m so glad that you were on that piece because sort of like you were saying, a lot of news, especially local news will focus on like crazy drivers and Dallas being as bad as it is, worse than Houston, worse than Phoenix, worse than Los Angeles in terms of road fatalities.</p>
<p>Does Dallas really have crazier drivers than Phoenix?</p>
<p>Does Dallas really have crazier drivers than Houston in the same state?</p>
<p>Seems unlikely.</p>
<p>What they have are worse roads.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And frankly, Dallas, I would argue probably has marginally worse roads than some of those other places.</p>
<p>Like Las Vegas is incredibly dangerous too.</p>
<p>So is Phoenix, so is Houston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve solved the problem there.</p>
<p>But for me, part of the reason why I was happy to spend a couple days in Texas with the reporters and be part of the story, and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was going to turn into.</p>
<p>It turned out frankly, like far more powerful and better than I expected.</p>
<p>I was happy to do it because I have the privilege of living in Washington, DC, which is a very expensive city.</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, it&rsquo;s one of the handful of places in the US like New York, where walking and biking as a main mode of transportation along with transit really is possible.</p>
<p>Most of this country is more like Dallas.</p>
<p>And I try to always hold myself accountable and try to remember that most of the United States doesn&rsquo;t look like the city where I live.</p>
<p>And if we really want to address the road safety problems that we have and solve our transportation issues, frankly, we have to think about the Dallas&rsquo;s of the country first and foremost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that is what makes, I think, seeing this kind of thing on a mainstream news outlet so interesting and encouraging.</p>
<p>To me, I mean, you write for a lot of different publications.</p>
<p>Do you think that these issues are getting a different or better kind of coverage from the mainstream media than they used to?</p>
<p>And what effect do you think that that might have in the long run?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s starting.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re at least asking some questions now that should have been asked a long time ago about the 85th percentile rule about right on red, which is insane.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t have it in New York, but most of the country does.</p>
<p>And it was introduced in most of the country in the 70s when we had a gas crisis way of saving gas.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a gas crisis anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it for decades.</p>
<p>We still have right on red in this country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m playing a role in that process of elevating some of these issues.</p>
<p>I think media is gradually coming around, but I actually think what&rsquo;s really most encouraging when I look to the future and look to how narratives are shifting, it&rsquo;s not so much how the media is changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually what I see among young people.</p>
<p>You mentioned, Sarah, my role at Harvard over the last several years in the Kennedy School.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to meet a lot of bright, energetic, often, not always, but often progressive 20 something year olds.</p>
<p>And when I would have like hopefully counted myself among that sort of a cohort, I spent some time in Cambridge myself in my 20s.</p>
<p>Nobody was really talking about cars.</p>
<p>Nobody was really talking about transportation.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t cool.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that interesting.</p>
<p>But now when I go and I give a talk about road safety or mobility as a service, Vision Zero, whatever it is, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are super excited and asking, how can I be a part of this campaign?</p>
<p>I mean, you see that if you look at like the Reddit fuck cars community, it&rsquo;s what 450,000 people or something insane like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s something happening generationally, at least with a subset of younger people that I find really encouraging.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to eventually permeate media and national discourse in a powerful way.</p>
<p>David, one of the things I really love about your work is that, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about this issue right now as road safety, but you actually focus a lot of attention on the cars themselves, you know, so it&rsquo;s not just about street design.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the 85th percentile or whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really focusing on the size of vehicles, the design and engineering of vehicles, the actual products that the auto industry is putting on our streets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re clearly not setting out to kill people, but their vehicles, their products seem to keep getting more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>So what is going on with the automobile industry?</p>
<p>What do you see happening?</p>
<p>So for this is a long term trend in 1977, 23 percent of new cars in America were SUVs or trucks.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s over 80 percent.</p>
<p>Just a stunning shift.</p>
<p>And in part, this is due to some federal regulations like the cafe loophole that allowed SUVs to be treated as like trucks and there&rsquo;s some other federal rules.</p>
<p>But a lot of that is due to the car companies trying to figure out how to make more money from a given sale.</p>
<p>SUVs and trucks are more expensive and more profitable than smaller cars than sedans and station wagons.</p>
<p>That is a big part of it.</p>
<p>And I was talking recently with a woman who spent many years as a product developer in one of the big car companies.</p>
<p>I was asking her, like, how do you actually think about the models that you&rsquo;re designing?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not, by the way, just that SUVs and trucks are taking over the car market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they themselves are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And what she told me, I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p>She says, well, look, you know, we all sit down in the beginning of a model refresh process and we ask, you know, like, how do we actually differentiate ourselves from our competitors?</p>
<p>And the first thing you turn to usually is maybe we provide more legroom, maybe we provide a little more power, maybe we provide a little more trunk space.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re starting from, you&rsquo;re naturally going to end up with a bigger, likely heavier vehicle.</p>
<p>And you just iterate that over 30 years, you can end up with cars becoming much bigger and much heavier than they were, you know, in a prior generation.</p>
<p>But the problem with these increasing vehicle sizes is not just about having more space in your trunk.</p>
<p>This has become an arms race on the road where people feel like they need to be in bigger and bigger cars.</p>
<p>And you actually wrote an article for Slate titled The Road Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you wrote that headline, but it&rsquo;s pretty accurate that these ever larger SUVs that everybody&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;m so safe in my SUV.</p>
<p>That is the exact thing that&rsquo;s making pedestrian fatality rates go up or contributing to that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just cosmetic, it&rsquo;s life threatening.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s the other side of the coin of what this woman who worked in automaker for many years was saying, because she basically was saying effectively, like, nobody really cares about the safety impacts when they&rsquo;re making these decisions.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t put it in those words, but that&rsquo;s the flip side of her point about, you know, trying to figure out ways to get a leg up on the competition, the safety issues for those outside the vehicle just don&rsquo;t factor in.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, Sarah, that story that I wrote in Slate, I think, was my attempt to really highlight these gigantic blind spots that emerge as a result, leading to the problems with car bloat.</p>
<p>But what I was trying to really argue is that we sort of set ourselves up in the United States for this problem that we now have with car bloat because of two problems that have come together now.</p>
<p>One is that we have always in this country associated road safety with car occupants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Ralph Nader wrote about in unsafe at any speed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve always considered road safety to entail is like, how do we keep you safe on the road?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basis of our crash test ratings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have set up our entire infrastructure at NHTSA to care about for decades and decades.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a consumer safety framework, right?</p>
<p>Consumer is the person who bought the product, bought the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the people outside the car.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not consumers, including, by the way, people in other cars.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you looking out for yourself.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, Aaron, the second point is that we have a road safety regime that is real, especially in the last 30 years has much to Ralph Nader&rsquo;s frustration sort of moved away from regulation and towards education.</p>
<p>The idea of informing people with a crash safety rating, how it likes the stars for cars program, or even with like, you know, programs that we probably like, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where we basically say like, who is your designated driver?</p>
<p>These are ways of sort of encouraging you to do the right thing as opposed to actually regulate.</p>
<p>So you just sort of let that dynamic play out for a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been telling Americans just for decades, you know, look out for protecting yourself inside a vehicle.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not actually doing anything from a regulation perspective, unlike a lot of other countries to force them as consumers or as car designers to think about the broader safety implications.</p>
<p>By extension, it&rsquo;s intuitive.</p>
<p>You end up with a sort of national fleet of cars that&rsquo;s going to be getting bigger and bigger and bigger, because people are looking out for their own self interest, even if overall, we would all prefer to be in a country with smaller cars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not how we&rsquo;re set up to drive.</p>
<p>Okay, David, I want to push back on something you said a little earlier, and I&rsquo;m doing this in the friendliest way possible.</p>
<p>You said that you didn&rsquo;t think people in the car industry were evil.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s generally true, right?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think anybody comes out of design school, you know, thinking, how can I kill the most people possible, they, they love cars, they think cars are cool, they grew up with like working on their dad&rsquo;s Mustang or something like that.</p>
<p>But once you are in an industry and you find out that, you know, you&rsquo;re working at the widget factory, and you find out that widgets are the leading killer of children in this country, or that 40,000 people die from using your products every year, what responsibility then do those people have to quit the industry, go find something else to do, change it from within, or be a whistleblower, let&rsquo;s say, you know, I think it relies on an interpretation of evil as like a snidely whiplash sort of character, when in reality, it&rsquo;s more the evil that we&rsquo;re sort of seeing in government overall, right, not just in corporations, but a sort of like going along with the status quo, never questioning it, because there&rsquo;s money to be made.</p>
<p>I mean, talking about looking out for ourselves, we&rsquo;re doing it in our cars, but we&rsquo;re also doing it in our livelihoods as well, right?</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to burn bridges with people that you&rsquo;ve, you know, cultivated in the auto industry, and you are a sharp critic of those people as well, and have gotten into it with them.</p>
<p>I know some of that, but I think like we have to maybe reframe the idea of like what it means for someone to either be or not be evil, right?</p>
<p>If I were working in that industry, and I found out that like front over crashes were going up as a result of design that I created, I might reconsider my place in that industry.</p>
<p>Or you know, we confronted the Dodge folks at the International Auto Show and said, you&rsquo;ve got this awful marketing that is just basically like a middle finger to everybody else who&rsquo;s out on the road, and worse than that, like pointing a gun at everybody else who&rsquo;s out on the road.</p>
<p>And what responsibility do these marketers have for kind of pulling back?</p>
<p>Granted, they&rsquo;re not going to, if government&rsquo;s not going to force them to, but I don&rsquo;t know, when I hear like, oh, people aren&rsquo;t evil, I&rsquo;m like, no, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true either, but they&rsquo;re not great actors either.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I just would caution against painting everybody works at a car company with a broad brush.</p>
<p>One example I worked on for Slate about Carbloat, I quoted the CTO of Stellantis who said like, it is a huge problem that our cars are getting ever heavier and ever bigger, we need to do something about this as an industry.</p>
<p>And you know what, I really appreciate that, that sort of like that kind of candor.</p>
<p>And on the flip side, Doug, and you&rsquo;ve probably seen this, I get pretty pissed off when I see car executives spouting bullshit, which does happen, to be clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of a like, I think you should leave hot dog meme of like, we&rsquo;re all trying to find the guy who did this when they said like, yeah, I think this is a huge problem, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And then you get the people who was just sort of obfuscate and say, oh, bigger SUVs and trucks isn&rsquo;t a source of people dying on roads, it&rsquo;s street lighting, which was something I heard from an executive, you might have seen this was on Twitter, a fight a couple months ago, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And we should call that out as being the baseless stuff that it is.</p>
<p>But I will say, Doug, and this is maybe where it&rsquo;s weird, I don&rsquo;t normally find myself in the position of defending cars.</p>
<p>But I think that tobacco, you could argue is a product that really did nobody any good.</p>
<p>It was just completely like we could have we could get rid of tobacco completely, we&rsquo;d be better off as a society.</p>
<p>The unfortunate reality of the United States right now is if you just sort of poof, remove all the cars, or you don&rsquo;t create any new cars, a lot of people in New York would be just fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be just fine in Washington DC, I&rsquo;m a bike commuter, I use transit, and I walk a lot.</p>
<p>But the reality is, we&rsquo;ve built up a country now where most people are going to see a serious decline in their quality of life if they cannot have access to a car.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very unfortunate reality, but it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Yes, I literally just said to someone like the most vexing part of this problem, when people do compare it to cigarettes, is that nobody ever wrote a cigarette to work, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That made it much easier.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t absolve the comp, just because people need a means, a personal mobility device, as my co-host Darren would say, to get their groceries, to get their little old lady grandmas to the hospital, to get to work, doesn&rsquo;t mean they need like the child crusher 3000 to do it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that the CEO of Stellantis should be like, I&rsquo;m quitting, and I&rsquo;m going to join the priesthood, and I&rsquo;m getting out of this business altogether.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like, what responsibility do they have to design a better product?</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s just this sort of cognitive disconnect when the guy running the corporation is like, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, like, how are we ever going to change anything?</p>
<p>I mean, you run the company that does it, my friend, and I understand that you have to answer to shareholders and all of that, but if not you, then who?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like we need the reverse to happen compared to what normally happens.</p>
<p>Normally people leave government regulation jobs to go work for private industry to help private industry get around government regulations.</p>
<p>We need these people to like have their come to Jesus moment and leave private industry to get into government regulation, basically.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it happening, Doug, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>Like yeah.</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>I guess this is part of why I&rsquo;m thinking through the questions that you posed and I&rsquo;m struggling a little bit because having talked with so many people in the car industry, I think a lot of them would like to do what you and I would say is the right thing, which is design smaller cars with their backs against the wall in their own minds for a few reasons.</p>
<p>One is like, you know, Sarah just mentioned it, they are publicly traded companies, so they have to be responsible to their shareholders.</p>
<p>And relatedly, they are spending a ton of money on R and D right now on electrification and they need that money to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>And they, by the way, they all just signed these new labor deals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to increase their labor costs.</p>
<p>So this is the other sort of like tough nut to crack with the car bloat problem is that SUVs and trucks are way more profitable than smaller cars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a whole other way of building a car when you are building sedans or smaller cars because you have to build like for quantity as opposed to like having a smaller runs with higher prices and more variation and fun add ons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard for them to make that kind of a shift.</p>
<p>In my view, the only way that really happens is not because they have this come to Jesus moral awakening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I think it&rsquo;s going to happen when regulation forces them to, which is why I talk a lot about state and federal regulations or you have a popular backlash, a broad popular backlash like what happened in the early sixties, partly because of the blow up over Ralph Nader&rsquo;s book, but also because of a whole variety of a number of us Senate investigation hearings, which we&rsquo;ve sort of forgotten about by I believe Ribbinkoff is his name, the senator that were transformative.</p>
<p>Those are the two directions like grassroots work and popular pressure or federal regulations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a sort of like moral reason for automakers to change.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t see it either.</p>
<p>And I think it gets back to what you were saying earlier, which is that not to offload every bit of responsibility to the younger generations, but they are maybe going to be part of this popular uprising that hopefully changes a little bit of what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope so.</p>
<p>OK, so things are not going to change because somebody has a moral epiphany and wakes up and devotes their life as the former CEO of Stellantis to to changing the world and the way that cars work in it.</p>
<p>I mean, if things are going to be solved by policy, what kind of policies are out there?</p>
<p>What kind of policies do you see?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve written about the possibility of speed governors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about weight limits.</p>
<p>You know, where do you see positive policy change happening that&rsquo;s scalable?</p>
<p>I tell you what I&rsquo;m most excited about are the innovations I see at the state and local level as a growing number of elected leaders and transportation officials just get frustrated with what we&rsquo;re all frustrated here.</p>
<p>The lack of action from Congress and from NHTSA, right?</p>
<p>So Sarah, you just alluded to a couple that I think are quite powerful.</p>
<p>One is in New York City.</p>
<p>I think it was a really smart move last year to launch a pilot with basically Intelligent Speed Assist, which is sort of like a smart speed limiter that adjusts to the speed limit on 50 vehicles within the city&rsquo;s fleet.</p>
<p>If the results are strong and they&rsquo;re doing research with the Volpe Center, a major research arm of US DOT, Mayor Adam said he wants to spread it across I think it&rsquo;s 30,000 vehicles in New York City government&rsquo;s fleet that are not emergency response.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m excited about that is because I don&rsquo;t see the US government adopting speed governors anytime soon, as insane as it is that we are able to buy cars that can go 40 miles over a speed limit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just no one needs to go 120 miles on a public road ever.</p>
<p>But if you focus on public fleets, they can provide an outsized benefit because not only are those cars going the speed limit or right around the speed limit, they actually slow down everybody behind or they prevent them from slowing them down.</p>
<p>They prevent them from reckless speeding.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually need every car to have a speed limiter to have a major improvement in street safety.</p>
<p>Hopefully, that at least is the aspiration.</p>
<p>So that Sarah is a policy idea fleet based speed regulators I think is potentially really exciting and I&rsquo;ll give New York City credit for being at the tip of the spear on that one.</p>
<p>So another one that I really like and I&rsquo;m going to take credit for this one because it&rsquo;s my city that went first is weight based car fees.</p>
<p>Because if NHTSA won&rsquo;t do anything about the car bloat and the risks it creates for everybody else on a street, then that&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>But states and cities can potentially find workarounds by playing with their registration fees or even parking fees to make them dramatically scale on the basis of car weight.</p>
<p>And the District of Columbia where I live adopted weight based car fees that actually had a 7x differential between how much it costs to register like a Hummer, I think it&rsquo;s $500 a year versus a small sedan.</p>
<p>I wrote a story for CityLab about this, which was a city fights back against heavyweight cars.</p>
<p>That is the headline I did write Sarah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking about another headline I did not write.</p>
<p>This one I did.</p>
<p>And that story went nuclear and it was exciting to see because it showed me just how much enthusiasm there is in the US, far outside of the District of Columbia for tangible ways of pushing back against car bloat.</p>
<p>So DC now does this, New York has a bill doing it, Colorado has proposed a bill, California is studying it.</p>
<p>And it strikes me as a very smart way of potentially addressing the car bloat issues that our federal government just seems uninterested in tackling.</p>
<p>David, we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about cars and car design, but I want to take a detour to Peachtree City, Georgia, which is one of my favorite stories of yours that you went down there and you&rsquo;ve written a lot about micro mobility and, you know, electric scooters and shared bicycles and things like that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about golf carts for a little bit.</p>
<p>So Doug, can I tell you a secret about Peachtree City?</p>
<p>I have a special source there.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something nobody knows.</p>
<p>Show with your audience.</p>
<p>My girlfriend grew up there.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s been singing the praises of golf carts for a while.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve obviously gone down with her and I was just fascinated by it because I don&rsquo;t know about you guys.</p>
<p>I would guess like before I wrote that story, what is the town that would you guys have golf carts in the US?</p>
<p>What did you think about?</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>You think of the villages in Florida.</p>
<p>Oh, I think of what is called Biscayne Bay.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You mentioned the villages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often what people what people say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard a lot of examples of like of basically like resort towns like Catalina Island and stuff like that and like coastal places.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so intriguing to me about Peachtree City is that it&rsquo;s neither a sort of like resort area or retirement community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an American suburb of, you know, 40 some thousand people with high schools and shopping malls and whatever else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was really curious to sort of I got, you know, I was already spending time there because that&rsquo;s where my partner&rsquo;s family is from.</p>
<p>But to actually just like sort of learn about how life revolves around these vehicles.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I spent some time down there, Doug, to say like, what&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really kind of inspiring, actually, to hear the stories about how people&rsquo;s lives have been enhanced.</p>
<p>You talk to the high schoolers who are like 15 years old and 14 years old and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, now I can go out and see my friends and we can go to the mall or go if we want without a parental chaperone.</p>
<p>And I feel so much more free.</p>
<p>And also I feel like I&rsquo;m a better driver in a car when I start doing that because I had the experience with a golf cart and parents don&rsquo;t have to pick up their kids from after school activities in their ninth grade or something because they can get home on their own.</p>
<p>Or you talk to older people who are retired.</p>
<p>I talked to one gentleman who had a big operation on his leg.</p>
<p>I think this I can&rsquo;t remember if this got cut from the story I did for Bloomberg Business Week.</p>
<p>But he said, like, look, I couldn&rsquo;t fold myself into a car to drive, but I could sit in a golf cart and it helped me like maintain my social connections and get to the store.</p>
<p>And of course, people are saving a lot of money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another issue, too, is like those who have limited incomes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great in that way.</p>
<p>So I think the most inspiring part of that story was just talking to families who said, like, yeah, like, we still drive into Atlanta or we drive to our job at the Atlanta airport because Petri City isn&rsquo;t far from it.</p>
<p>But when we&rsquo;re at home, you know, we have this network of golf cart pads, which is really the sine qua non of the whole system there.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m with my family and we&rsquo;re going to go out for a meal or go to a park, we never take a car.</p>
<p>We always get in the golf cart and it&rsquo;s so much nicer and we get to know our neighbors so much more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so much better.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed that story, Doug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you said you did.</p>
<p>I love that story for exactly that reason, because it put mobility as a sort of tool and you&rsquo;re using the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>So like you said, if they have to go long distances, they break out the SUV fine.</p>
<p>But for the trip to the grocery store or to see their friends, they&rsquo;re just hopping in this little electric golf cart.</p>
<p>And when you when you go to a city like Oslo, Norway, and I believe you were there, right, David?</p>
<p>So you see cars on the street because they&rsquo;re doing a lot to encourage electric cars for better or for worse, but you do see vehicles like the Renault Twizy, which I&rsquo;ve often fantasized about like, man, it would be nice to start a Twizy dealership in Manhattan.</p>
<p>It basically is a golf cart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very fancy little golf cart.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like kind of looks cooler, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost the same form factor.</p>
<p>And I mean, is there any way that you can imagine policy where cities are able to encourage and incentivize those kinds of vehicles replacing these big bloated, crappy, dangerous, dirty auto industry products?</p>
<p>I mean, they could still be auto industry products, just a different kind of product parking spots that are only six feet long.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting, Doug, because I imagine on street parking might be the best lever we have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what like what can cities do, David, to like start to discourage big, dirty, dangerous auto industry products and start to replace those products with lighter, cleaner, less expensive, more socially responsible personal mobility devices.</p>
<p>Skip the subsidies because golf carts like e-cargo bikes are already way cheaper than a new car in America.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so unbelievably expensive to buy a new car in this country.</p>
<p>And instead.</p>
<p>But what do you mean?</p>
<p>What do you mean, skip the subsidy?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not the place to focus the place to focus.</p>
<p>If you really want to move the needle on golf cart adoption, in my view, is to build safe places to use them separated from our behemoths of full size cars.</p>
<p>That could mean golf cart paths, ideally like you have in Peachtree City, but that&rsquo;s not going to be feasible in a big city or even a built out suburb where we&rsquo;d have to a retrofit.</p>
<p>What you do there is you build a network of slow speed streets that are 25 miles an hour so that the golf cart users can get wherever they want to go, even if they&rsquo;re not using every street, every road in the whole region, they can get wherever they want to go without having to share a lane with an SUV that weighs like three times as much and is traveling three times as fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>
<p>So you think we can&rsquo;t really force change on the auto industry.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say like, Hey, you guys need to change your products to meet these specifications like lighter, cheaper, cleaner, safer.</p>
<p>Instead the onus goes on us, the public, the city with our stretched municipal budgets.</p>
<p>We have to go and transform our city like pour concrete, put up bollards, do all these, like build a whole new transportation infrastructure for the kinds of vehicles we want.</p>
<p>It feels a little bit like, you know, you&rsquo;re sort of letting private industry off the hook.</p>
<p>Like you guys go continue to make your bad products.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go bulletproof our city.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to armor it up and create this separate safe space in the hopes that these other products flourish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Aaron, I guess I would say that it&rsquo;s the right thing for cities to do regardless is to build safe places to travel that are no vehicles going faster than 25 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Not just to encourage golf guards, but to the people who wanted to, to use a bicycle or an e-bike or a cargo bike, don&rsquo;t have to worry about being clipped and struck and injured or killed by the passing SUV.</p>
<p>But in what scenario, like we still have cars, we still have these.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re out there on bikes as we are now here in New York city.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like how we all get around and we&rsquo;re mixing with, you know, 5,000 pound SUVs that can go zero to 60 in four seconds.</p>
<p>Like why should that product, why should that personal mobility product be allowed to be used in our city?</p>
<p>Like, and how is it okay to encourage more of us to be biking and being out in golf carts when these incredibly dangerous products are on the street too?</p>
<p>But couldn&rsquo;t the cities do something that doesn&rsquo;t cost them a lot of money about that?</p>
<p>For example, we have congestion pricing coming.</p>
<p>So using DC&rsquo;s example of a weight base beyond parking or registration, let&rsquo;s say, couldn&rsquo;t you say like, okay, the congestion pricing fee is $9.</p>
<p>But if your car weighs more than 6,000 pounds, it&rsquo;s $50.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like there are things that we could do that aren&rsquo;t going to cost the city money and ultimately will be cheaper for preventing the death and destruction and infrastructure damage that these larger cars are doing.</p>
<p>And I think you can do that with parking too.</p>
<p>You could be like if you want to park a behemoth on the, you know, the on-street.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s $2 an hour for everybody except for you in your behemoth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s $17.</p>
<p>But David, it just, I just feel like so I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize you because I feel like this is the, the set of policy proposal, you know, we sometimes have called ourselves a livable streets movement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been very focused on streets.</p>
<p>It just feels to me after 20 years of this, like it&rsquo;s not working that well.</p>
<p>Like, like I don&rsquo;t feel safer on the street on my bike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super comfortable with my kids biking still.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t really focus on the cars and the car industry products and they keep getting more dangerous.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I really want a set of policies that does something about that.</p>
<p>So give it to me.</p>
<p>Give it to me, David.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no single policy that&rsquo;s going to fix this sort of like deep hole we&rsquo;ve dug ourselves into with, with ubiquitous cars that are often too big and too powerful and too dangerous in this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of biting off little pieces of the puzzle and those solutions are going to be partial.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also going to depend on the environment in which we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like Peachtree city is a wonderful example that could be emulated by new suburbs that are being built from scratch and master developed.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say like the excerpts of Phoenix or Orlando or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that Peachtree city has a lot to tell us about what to do in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>To be totally honest.</p>
<p>But I think what Aaron is saying is, you know, we were talking about Ralph Nader earlier and you know, the impact that his work had on road safety was just so tremendous.</p>
<p>So outscale.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t little nibbles here and there, right?</p>
<p>Because we got seat belts, we got airbags, we got like saved thousands of lives.</p>
<p>And we did that by sitting down in front of the United States Congress and making it crystal clear to the members of Congress and also to the American public that there was a product safety problem that was at least in part motivated by corporate greed, right?</p>
<p>And unwillingness to put the money in to do these safety improvements without being forced.</p>
<p>And I guess, I mean, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like we need a Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s David.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was David.</p>
<p>I actually do think I would sometimes read your stuff and I&rsquo;m like, oh, David could be the Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like what, you know.</p>
<p>So have you been invited to testify in front of Congress?</p>
<p>Are you going to run for president in 2024?</p>
<p>Is there some scenario in which you could see yourself testifying in front of a committee, you know, you or somebody else and really just opening people&rsquo;s eyes to these, these products are unsafe at any speed?</p>
<p>At any size.</p>
<p>At any size, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Nader&rsquo;s book was transformative for thinking about product safety of cars, right?</p>
<p>And how cars were endangering people inside of them.</p>
<p>Although I will add one thing, Sarah, to the little history you shared there.</p>
<p>When Nader&rsquo;s book first came out unsafe at any speed, it was not immediately a hit.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to keep this in mind.</p>
<p>It was like, you know, some people read it.</p>
<p>It was okay.</p>
<p>It was fine.</p>
<p>You know what turned it into the sort of like breakthrough bestseller transformative book that we know of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because General Motors hired detectives to sort of clumsily look for dirt in Nader&rsquo;s background, like trying to like hook him up with prostitutes or whatever, got nowhere.</p>
<p>And then this, then this news got out.</p>
<p>And when that happened, you guys know this story?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t know this story?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I knew that they tried to dig up dirt on him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They found nothing.</p>
<p>They found nothing.</p>
<p>Like Nader is like squeaky clean.</p>
<p>The news of this investigation got out.</p>
<p>And now you have, I think the technical term is a shit show.</p>
<p>And GM, this is actually a really fascinating moment in American history.</p>
<p>GM backpedaled.</p>
<p>It was just one of the biggest corporate cell phones in American history, I would say.</p>
<p>And General Motors did a big payout to Nader, who then used that money not to buy himself a new house, but to actually fund these consumer advocacy organizations that basically made him a national here.</p>
<p>So I just, so I, first of all, I just think the story is fascinating is why I bring it up.</p>
<p>But also I just want to be clear, it wasn&rsquo;t simply like Nader published the book and everything changed.</p>
<p>Nader published a book.</p>
<p>It did okay.</p>
<p>It built on some momentum is already coming along.</p>
<p>And then General Motors just shot itself in the foot in the biggest way possible.</p>
<p>So David, you need to write a book, Stellantis needs to like see if you&rsquo;ve got any skeletons in your closet and then you&rsquo;ll ride that Streisand effect to banning SUVs.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s a broader point you were making, which I didn&rsquo;t address yet, which was like, how do you actually get the policymakers to care?</p>
<p>I mean, I live in DC. I&rsquo;ve actually spoken with congressmen and representatives and people in power about this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, I was talking with Earl Blumenauer.</p>
<p>You guys may know him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about to retire.</p>
<p>Adam on the pod.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guest on the podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Friend of the podcast.</p>
<p>Great guy.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like a hero for people like biking in particular.</p>
<p>I asked him like, what&rsquo;s the deal with car bloat and with cars?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Is there any interest among your colleagues to do something?</p>
<p>And he basically was like, they&rsquo;re scared shitless of doing anything like that.</p>
<p>Even if they know it&rsquo;s a problem, because there&rsquo;s this this conflation of cars and freedom in the American mind, which automakers have really built up with all their ads and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>And he was very candid with me sort of saying, like, look, there&rsquo;s got to be a public push to force us to do something.</p>
<p>And this is a guy who wants to do something like there has to be a ground solo support.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, just to bring it full circle, look, like you were saying nice things about me.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that, but I&rsquo;ll say, like, look, I think you guys and podcasts like yours play an important role, because even if you are like a lot of people you&rsquo;re reaching, I think are already on the team.</p>
<p>Not everyone.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some who learn about the problems with cars through it.</p>
<p>But you really need deeper, stronger, broader organizations like this to sort of create the cover for elected leaders to make the decisions that they&rsquo;re just not making right now in Congress and also in a lot of state governments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good place to wrap it up.</p>
<p>Yeah, David, we really appreciate, you know, your output.</p>
<p>I think, you know, you&rsquo;re writing so many of these and every now and then something breaks through to Dallas local TV news.</p>
<p>So we really, we really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Your pen is a sword.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In the war on cars.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We just need to build a much, much bigger team.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a great part of that.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for coming on the war on cars.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s my pleasure to be with you.</p>

<p>As of iOS17, it would appear that responsibility for synthesizing the Default Greeting <em>preview</em> (locally on one&rsquo;s device) has now fallen to whichever Siri voice you currently have selected in settings at the time.</p>
<p>Upon noticing this, I verified that the actual recording a missed caller will hear is the same (apparently carrier-side) as its been since before the trees and rocks on Earth and it occurred to me just how much better stock, out of the box Siri Voice 2 sounds than her, so I gave it a shot.</p>
<p>I plan to leave it as my greeting for the time being so - if you&rsquo;re curious/require hearing what your missed callers will actually hear - horrendous noise and all - I would encourage you to <a href="tel://5738234380"><strong>call me, anytime</strong></a>). I do not experience or follow up with unknown callers unless they leave a voicemail&hellip; which I&rsquo;d also be more than fine with you doing.</p>
<p><strong>+1 (573) 823-4380</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Sorry about the narrative - I found the experience about to recount oddly significant.</em></p>
<p>Its gist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital payments on-site do not appear to be functioning as of late June 2023.</li>
<li>I <em>was</em> able to use cash successfully.</li>
<li>Though it&rsquo;d obviously been long-abandoned, the water that came out during the rinse cycle, at least, was free of debris and did not smell of poo poo.</li>
<li>The employee of the Break Time told me that:
<ol>
<li>The store had been able to sell working car wash codes for as long as she&rsquo;d worked there.</li>
<li>It had been a notably long time since &ldquo;anybody&rdquo; had been able to get in contact with the owners of the car wash.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I was visiting my sister&rsquo;s lake house this past June (the 18th I believe) having just taken my first road trip in 4 years in my (new to me) Golf. I had gotten the car fairly dirty on my way there - having driven the <a href="https://www.myrouteapp.com/en/social/route/7933748">longest route I could</a> from Columbia, basically. I asked my brother-in-law about car washes in the area and he mentioned &ldquo;the one behind Break Time,&rdquo; though couldn&rsquo;t tell me whether or not it was still opened.</p>
<p>With post-COVID hours, I was pushing it when I arrived at ~10:40PM with like 3 quarters to my name. So freakin thankful, immediately, that no music was being played (the last do-it-yourself washes in Columbia - Lighthouse Car Wash - play pop radio so loud it&rsquo;s actually hard to concentrate.) I was curious about the prospect of using my debit card as soon as I saw the sign indicating that it had to be done in a singular location, where I found an (absolutely adorable, apparently locally made?) interface that appeared to be stuck on the authorization screen for a prior transaction.</p>
<p>Before I proceeded - and perhaps actually relevant to purpose of such a review (sorry) - I walked up to the Break Time, where the last shift was closing solo. I brought up the car wash and she immediately noted that they &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t heard from them in months,&rdquo; and that the store ⇨ wash payment processing hadn&rsquo;t been working since she&rsquo;d started there.</p>
<p>&hellip;so!</p>
<p>I decided to at least try rebooting the on-site payment terminal with the master breaker switch (which is very large and very visibly placed, I should say,) if only because I thought it&rsquo;d be interesting to watch such a legacy, time-worn piece of automation come back to life.</p>
<p>&hellip;and it was! I got to see the terminal boot from a quite sophisticated script and the sound of everything settling into place was enchanting, pitifully.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though this did clear the error, it landed on (and got stuck) the exact same error when I tried my card lol</p>
<p>I had enough cash to rinse my car off, which was all I really needed in the end. That evening was one I&rsquo;ll never forget (for other reasons too,) and I would encourage the owners of that car wash - if they happen to see this - to contact MFA Corporate (my employers) at their main phone number. Ya never know - they&rsquo;ve expanded stores a lot and they might be interested in the property.</p>

<p name="cd7f" id="cd7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I am looking for a method to output current performance values (like current % cpu, for instance) of a macos machine to the command line standard output.</p>
<h4 name="4582" id="4582" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">ChatGPT:</h4>
<p name="b69d" id="b69d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To monitor and output current performance values, including CPU usage, of a macOS machine to the command line standard output, you can use various commands and utilities. One commonly used command is <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code>. You can run the following command in your macOS terminal:</p>
<pre name="de4a" id="de4a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">top -l 1 | grep "CPU usage"</code></pre>
<p name="d427" id="d427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">This command will provide a one-time snapshot of CPU usage. The <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">-l 1</code> option tells <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code> to only run once, and <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">grep "CPU usage"</code> filters the relevant lines to display CPU usage information.</p>
<p name="4af0" id="4af0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want continuous monitoring, you can run <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code> without <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">-l 1</code> to see real-time updates. Press <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">q</code> to exit <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code> when you're done.</p>
<p name="a6c4" id="a6c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can also use specific utilities like <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">htop</code> or <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">iStat Menus</code> if you want a more detailed and interactive performance monitoring tool.</p>
<p name="4f0b" id="4f0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Feel free to ask for more details or other performance metrics you’d like to monitor.</p>

<pre name="040d" id="040d" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">top -l 1 | awk '/CPU usage/ {print $7}'</code></pre>
<p name="06bf" id="06bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">This command will display the combined CPU usage as a percentage value. The <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">awk</code> command looks for lines containing "CPU usage" and prints the 7th column, which is the combined CPU usage percentage.</p>
<p name="2734" id="2734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want to calculate and display only the total CPU usage percentage without the labels, this command will do the job for you.</p>

<p name="ef4b" id="ef4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To embed the snippet into the command and replace “PLACEHOLDER” with the CPU usage percentage, you can use command substitution. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

<p name="65eb" id="65eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To get the percentage value of current memory used, you can use the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code> command again, but this time, you'll need to extract the memory usage information.

<pre name="75d4" id="75d4" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">widget memory.fill "$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print $8}') memory used"</code></pre>
<p name="77cc" id="77cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">This command will run the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top</code> command to retrieve the percentage of physical memory used and then use it to replace "PLACEHOLDER" in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">widget memory.fill</code> command. The <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">awk</code> command extracts the memory usage percentage, which is in the 8th column of the output.</p>

<p name="1086" id="1086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When running the following snippet, I seem to be getting an empty value:</p>
<p name="8203" id="8203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ \{print $8}'</code></p>
<p name="ba65" id="ba65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But running the following snippet:</p>
<p name="1a25" id="1a25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/'</code></p>

<p name="889e" id="889e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I’m assuming there needs to be additional manipulation of the output above to convert it into percentage of PhysMem currently used. How would I do that?</p>

<p name="68b6" id="68b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You’re correct; you need to perform additional manipulation to convert the memory usage into a percentage value. Here’s how you can modify the command to achieve that:</p>
<pre name="29bc" id="29bc" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">widget memory.fill "$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print int(($8 / $2) * 100)}')% memory used"</code></pre>
<p name="b5e2" id="b5e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">In this updated command, we use <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">int(($8 / $2) * 100)</code> to calculate the percentage of physical memory used. It divides the amount used (8th column) by the total physical memory (2nd column) and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage. The result is then appended with "% memory used" and used to replace "PLACEHOLDER" in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">widget memory.fill</code> command.</p>
<p name="30d2" id="30d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This should provide you with the percentage of physical memory currently used.</p>
<h4 name="ee2c" id="ee2c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">You:</h4>
<p name="bfc5" id="bfc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">That snippet is returning a value of 0, which does not reflect the actual percent memory used value.</p>

<p name="d1e7" id="d1e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I apologize for the incorrect command earlier. To calculate the percentage of memory used accurately, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre name="e8dc" id="e8dc" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">widget memory.fill "$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {used = $8; total = $2; sub(/M/, "", used); sub(/G/, "000M", total); print int(used / total * 100)}')% memory used"</code></pre>
<p name="cbce" id="cbce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">This command will correctly calculate the percentage of physical memory used by converting both used and total memory to a common unit (in this case, megabytes) and then calculating the percentage.

<p name="61c0" id="61c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To extract just the numeric value of the first percent (from left to right — “82” in your example), you can use the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">awk</code> command. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<pre name="06e8" id="06e8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">df -h | grep disk1s1 | awk '{print $6}' | cut -d "%" -f 1</code></pre>
<p name="7b87" id="7b87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre graf--trailing">This command will first use <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">awk</code> to extract the 6th column (which contains the percentage value), and then it will use <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">cut</code> to remove the "%" symbol. The result will be the numeric value "82."</p>

<p>Howdy folks!</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m not missing something - I&rsquo;ve searched the forums, subreddit, etc. off and on for the past few months for any discussion on the matter, but haven&rsquo;t found anything quite directly related enough to get me started on my own solution, so I thought I&rsquo;d reach out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with Publish for a lil bit, though I have been putting off investigating methods of customizing how permalinks are published.</p>
<p>To be as succinct as I can, my end goal is essentially just two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The automated addition of a given note&rsquo;s public Publish URL (ex: <code>https://publish.obsidian.md/extratone/meta/Automatically+Adding+Public+Obsidian+Publish+URLs+to+Notes%3F</code>) as a <code>url</code> property in the frontmatter.</li>
<li>Ideally, the ability to add a markdown-formatted hyperlink of the same (<code>[Note Title](publishurl)</code>) at the cursor with a single hotkey.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s absurd to think I&rsquo;m the only one seeking such a function - apologies if this is redundant.</p>

<p>What is the best way to dissuade a repeat offender from catcalling without involving law enforcement?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT:</h3>
<p>Addressing catcalling without involving law enforcement can be challenging but here are some non-legal approaches you can consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay assertive and confident: If you feel safe doing so, respond firmly and confidently to the catcaller, making it clear that their behavior is unacceptable.</li>
<li>Ignore and walk away: Sometimes, ignoring the catcaller can be the best option, as engaging with them might encourage further harassment.</li>
<li>Seek support from bystanders: If you feel comfortable, ask nearby people for help or support in the situation.</li>
<li>Create awareness: Talk to friends, family, and online communities about catcalling to raise awareness and foster a collective effort against it.</li>
<li>Support organizations: Get involved with or support organizations that work against street harassment to make a broader impact.</li>
<li>Educate: Encourage discussions about consent, respect, and harassment to help change attitudes and behavior.</li>
<li>Report incidents to relevant establishments: If the catcalling occurs in a public place or business, consider reporting the incident to the establishment&rsquo;s management.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, your safety is the top priority. If a situation feels unsafe or escalates, prioritize your well-being and consider seeking help from authorities or others nearby.</p>
<h3 id="you-1">You:</h3>
<p>I was hoping to take action on behalf of my girlfriend, actually, who has been the actual target of said catcalling while walking downtown.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-1">ChatGPT:</h3>
<p>I understand your concern for your girlfriend&rsquo;s well-being. Here are some ways you can support her and take action against catcalling:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate her feelings: Let her know that you believe her and that her feelings of discomfort or frustration are valid.</li>
<li>Encourage communication: Talk openly with her about how she feels and what actions she would like to take, ensuring she feels heard and supported.</li>
<li>Accompany her: Offer to walk with her in downtown areas where she has experienced catcalling, as having a supportive presence can provide a sense of safety.</li>
<li>Help her report incidents: If she feels comfortable doing so, assist her in reporting specific incidents of catcalling to local authorities or relevant organizations.</li>
<li>Advocate for safe public spaces: Raise awareness about the issue of catcalling in your community and support efforts to create safe and respectful public spaces.</li>
<li>Encourage self-defense training: If she&rsquo;s interested, consider encouraging her to take self-defense classes, which can provide her with valuable skills and confidence.</li>
<li>Share resources: Provide her with information on organizations that support victims of street harassment, as they may offer guidance and assistance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, your role as a supportive partner is essential, but always respect her wishes and decisions on how to address the situation. It&rsquo;s essential to prioritize her safety and well-being in any action taken.</p>
<h3 id="you-2">You:</h3>
<p>If I were to approach the catcaller myself in public without any hostile or threatening intent, how might I go about effectively making the argument that he should not be catcalling?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-2">ChatGPT:</h3>
<p>Approaching a catcaller can be a delicate situation, and it&rsquo;s crucial to prioritize safety for both yourself and your girlfriend. If you decide to have a conversation with the catcaller, consider the following tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay calm and composed: Approach the situation with a level-headed demeanor to keep the conversation constructive and avoid escalating tensions.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements: Frame your points from a personal perspective, expressing how catcalling affects your girlfriend and others around her, rather than placing blame or accusing the catcaller.</li>
<li>Be assertive and respectful: Firmly state that catcalling is unacceptable behavior and can cause distress or fear to those on the receiving end.</li>
<li>Educate on the impact: Explain the harmful effects of catcalling on individuals' mental and emotional well-being, emphasizing that respectful behavior is essential in public spaces.</li>
<li>Appeal to empathy: Encourage the catcaller to imagine how they would feel if someone close to them were subjected to similar harassment.</li>
<li>Ask questions: Engage the catcaller in a conversation to understand their perspective and reasons behind their actions. Sometimes, this can lead to self-reflection and awareness.</li>
<li>Stay safe and disengage if necessary: If the person becomes defensive or hostile, prioritize your safety and exit the situation calmly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that while addressing the catcaller directly can be empowering, it might not always lead to immediate change. People&rsquo;s attitudes and behaviors can be deeply ingrained, so approaching the situation with empathy and understanding can be more effective than aggression or hostility. Ultimately, the goal is to promote respect and create a safer environment for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="you-3">You:</h3>
<p>If I were to approach the catcaller myself in public without any hostile or threatening intent, how might I go about effectively making the argument that he should not be catcalling?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-3">ChatGPT:</h3>
<p>If you decide to approach the catcaller to address the issue of catcalling, here are some tips to effectively convey your message:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the right moment: Look for an appropriate time when the catcaller appears to be calm and approachable to have a more productive conversation.</li>
<li>Use a calm and respectful tone: Start the conversation with a friendly and non-confrontational tone. Avoid aggressive language, as it may lead to defensiveness and hinder communication.</li>
<li>Be specific and clear: Clearly express that catcalling is inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. Explain how it can make others feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and disrespected.</li>
<li>Share personal experiences: If you feel comfortable, share how catcalling has affected your girlfriend or others you know, emphasizing the negative impact it can have on their well-being.</li>
<li>Appeal to empathy: Encourage the catcaller to consider how they would feel if someone treated their loved ones in a similar manner.</li>
<li>Highlight the importance of respect: Emphasize the significance of treating others with respect and how it contributes to a more harmonious and compassionate community.</li>
<li>Stay composed and composed: Keep your emotions in check, as getting angry or emotional might hinder the effectiveness of the conversation.</li>
<li>Listen to their perspective: Give the catcaller an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings. Active listening can help build understanding and establish a more open dialogue.</li>
<li>Offer alternative perspectives: Suggest that they engage in positive interactions with others in public spaces, such as giving compliments in a respectful and appropriate manner.</li>
<li>Know when to disengage: If the catcaller becomes aggressive, disrespectful, or unresponsive, it&rsquo;s best to disengage from the conversation to avoid any escalation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, approaching a catcaller can be challenging, and not everyone may be receptive to your message. Your primary concern should be your safety and the safety of those around you. If the situation becomes uncomfortable or hostile, it&rsquo;s essential to prioritize your well-being and consider seeking assistance from authorities or removing yourself from the situation.</p>
<h3 id="you-4">You:</h3>
<p>If this proves ineffective and I do end up deciding to involve the authorities after all, how might I go about doing so with extra care to avoid putting the safety of the catcaller - who is an elderly black man - at any more risk than absolutely necessary?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-4">ChatGPT:</h3>
<p>If you find it necessary to involve the authorities due to persistent catcalling or harassment, it&rsquo;s essential to handle the situation with care, especially when the person involved is an elderly individual from a vulnerable community. Here are some steps to take while prioritizing safety and sensitivity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Document incidents: Keep a record of the date, time, and location of each catcalling incident. Note any details about what was said or any witnesses present.</li>
<li>Speak to a local community organization: Before involving law enforcement, consider reaching out to a local community organization that deals with issues related to harassment or discrimination. They may provide guidance and support on how to handle the situation effectively.</li>
<li>Choose an appropriate authority to contact: If the catcalling is happening on public property, consider contacting the local police non-emergency line to report the incidents. If it&rsquo;s occurring on private property, such as at a business, you could also speak to the management of that establishment.</li>
<li>Provide detailed information: When reporting the incidents, be factual and specific about the occurrences without making assumptions about the catcaller&rsquo;s background or motivations.</li>
<li>Emphasize the concern for safety: Express your concern for your girlfriend&rsquo;s safety and well-being, and focus on the impact of the behavior rather than the identity of the catcaller.</li>
<li>Request sensitivity and cultural awareness: Ask the authorities to approach the situation with sensitivity, taking into account the catcaller&rsquo;s age and ethnicity, to avoid any unnecessary escalation or harm.</li>
<li>Be prepared for different outcomes: Understand that the response from authorities may vary, but make sure they are aware of your desire to handle the situation with care.</li>
<li>Follow up: If the situation persists or escalates after involving the authorities, continue to document incidents and communicate with the relevant parties to ensure appropriate action is taken.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the goal is to address the issue of catcalling and harassment while prioritizing safety for everyone involved. Engaging with local community organizations or seeking guidance from resources that focus on these issues can provide valuable insights on handling the situation with empathy and respect.</p>

<p name="4c55" id="4c55" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">This essay seeks to examine the breadth of donor-funded, open source, federated social networks as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">technical</em> alternatives to commercial online environments like Facebook and Twitter as measured by their users’ overall satisfaction with them as means of social interactivity over time. Following recent debates and confusion regarding the ethics in the practices of the organizations which built them and the extent of their complicity in the radical cultural consequences of digital communication surrounding the United States’ Presidential Election in 2016, it proposes that greater rhetorical and legislative attention be invested in the tangible, documented design decisions across their products’ history as the most crucial, relevant, and effective means of understanding the whole context, within which it will define <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">open source software development</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">federated networking</em> in contrast to the guarded industry establishment which the dominant services have transitioned from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">disrupting</em> by design to entirely exemplifying thus far in the century. After examining conspicuous alterations and inexplicably silent feature additions and subtractions across the whole of social network development, as well as their eventual result’s reflections on the conscious satisfaction of individual Social Media users, it will conclude by profiling a select few communities thriving on donation-funded, collaboratively maintained, and/or decentralized platforms as superior foundations upon which citizens of the web might rebuild their own traumatized and fragmented networks when they are ready to begin again.</p>
<h3 name="7d41" id="7d41" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Introduction</h3>
<p name="3310" id="3310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If we accept Electronic Mail as the absolute genesis of what we call “Social Media,” the term becomes inextricably linked with <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd" data-href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the history of the World Wide Web as a whole</a>. The technical protocol we know as Email is by nature “decentralized,” “distributed,” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">and</em> “federated” as the terms are used in this essay because it is technically unbeholden to any single transmission or client service — commercial or not — and it allows users to participate with any server installation they choose, up to and including personal email servers <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server" data-href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">installed in one’s home</a>. In this essay, “decentralized social networks,” “distributed social platforms,” and “federated social networking” fall together under the category of “open web technologies,” which are <a href="http://www.openwebfoundation.org/" data-href="http://www.openwebfoundation.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by definition non-proprietary</a>. This essay proceeds under the notable assumption that The Web as a whole “was, at its core and in its design, a democratizing technology,” and that its potential to be more “open” will remain limitless as long as its <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php" data-href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fundamental structure is at all recognizable as The Web</a>. In fact, using the adjectives “decentralized” and “distributed” in front of any web-native technologies could be considered oxymoronic, as The Web’s existence as an entity comprised of many interconnecting interconnections without any requisite central spaces or governing bodies remains technically unmolested, despite the encroaching would-be for-profit adjudicators Google and Facebook. (While the abrupt and total disappearance of either or both company’s total online proprietorship would be a massive event, the remainder of The Web would continue to function.)</p>
<p name="b89f" id="b89f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Email is undoubtedly a form of social <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">networking</em>, though it was the addition of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) — a parallel technology — that manifested what many scholars have offered as the first published media for the sake of socializing online. Four key pillars of Social Media services in their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">current</em> form were arrived upon within an editorial issue <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377" data-href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduction for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Telecommunications Policy</em></a>:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li name="13ce" id="13ce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The software powering Social Media services are definitive “Web 2.0” properties, as platforms “for creating and publishing content, and also [places] where content can be ‘continuously modified by all users in a participatory and collaborative fashion.’”</li>
<li name="d4cc" id="d4cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social Media services are primarily driven by <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">User</em>-Generated Content.</li>
<li name="f268" id="f268" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social Media services include a directorial functionality which enables users to create “profiles” to represent themselves.</li>
<li name="9c58" id="9c58" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Social Media services “facilitate the development of social networks” by the interconnection of user profiles as units.</li>
</ol>
<p name="5314" id="5314" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In 1996, Poet, Grateful Dead ghostwriter, and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation John Perry Barlow published a manifesto entitled <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence" data-href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em></a> which proves an insightful abstract into the most romanticized, principled, and abstractly ideological thought of that period surrounding The Web’s future.</p>
<blockquote name="c50c" id="c50c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.</blockquote>
<p name="eac7" id="eac7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">From our retrospective, the bravado in Barlow’s declarations addressed specifically to “Governments of the Industrial World” presents an important contrast on which to reflect. Current events surrounding regulation of the tech industry reflect a general desire for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> government intervention from both mainstream political parties in the United States. As I write, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an appearance by the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook</a> in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee has just concluded, during which both fielded questions from senators of both mainstream parties, largely regarding “censorship” on their platforms performed by the companies themselves. It is beyond the scope of this essay to address the particulars of this issue, so we are going to continue under the assumption that privately-owned social platforms have the constitutional right to censor, manipulate, or otherwise editorialize User-Generated Content (UGC) as­ they see fit, but it will outline specific advantages with regard to “The Censorship Issue” offered by current Federated Social platforms. The reality of Barlow’s fears in 2020: even if the United States government had intentions to regulate speech on The Web, it has consistently demonstrated an inability to comprehend the meaning of such action, much less an ability to enforce legislation within the realm of online speech.</p>
<p name="f447" id="f447" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This essay cites heavily from meta-media publications like the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Columbia Journalism Review</em> and Harvard’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Nieman Lab</em>, as well as from several individual articles oriented around the subject of social media’s impact on the way news is consumed, skewing its bias toward the media industry in many ways. I pursued this direction in order to make what I believe to be an original suggestion: Federated Social Platforms are ideal solutions to this issue, too, largely because of their widespread omission of any non-linear (algorithmic) content prioritization in timelines. Much like Twitter’s original design, content on services like Mastodon and Diaspora appears in a purely-chronological “Timeline,” which — if still present — is now a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally" data-href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highly-obscured option</a> in mainstream proprietary networks. Inevitably, it discusses recent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms (which I will occasionally refer to as “Big Social”) to reform aggregative processes within their functions as news-sharing services as it cites the research critics have referenced in response.</p>
<h4 name="458f" id="458f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Origins</h4>
<p name="3b33" id="3b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">While user-maintained Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) like Usenet and Fidonet established Open Web forums in the 1980s, a proprietary parallel called CompuServe migrated from its original implementation as a “<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking" data-href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">business-oriented mainframe computer communication solution</a>” to the public domain. As of Fall 1994, CompuServe charged $8.95 per month ($15.94, adjusted for inflation) for “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unlimited use of its standard services</a>,” which included “news, sports, weather, travel, reference libraries, stock quotes, games and limited electronic mail,” and between $4.80 and $22.80 per <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hour</em> ($8.55 to $40.61, adjusted for inflation) for use of its “’extended’ services,” including a variety of discussion forums established by topic. In the 1990s, it would be joined by competing internet service providers Prodigy and America Online, the latter of which originated the first “member profiles” for users, forming the third pillar of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Telecommunications Policy</em>’s Social Media requisites.</p>
<p name="70cb" id="70cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Inheriting the environment pioneered by these original titans were the first college-oriented networking sites like Classmates.com, myYearbook.com, and SixDegrees.com. The former introduced the concept of user discovery by way of grassroots associations and has managed to survive (in some form) to this day. SixDegrees was notable as “one of the very first [Social Networks] to allow its users to create profiles, invite friends, organize groups, and surf other user profiles.” Following social development of the original services goliaths and these insular collegiate networks, another microcosm sprouted up within this first generation of ethnic-oriented networks such as AsianAvenue.com and BlackPlanet.com, which both continue operation to date.</p>
<h4 name="7b31" id="7b31" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Friendly Frenzy</h4>
<p name="fb29" id="fb29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The meat of the social media industry’s curve throughout its history up to this point is occupied by a string of networks — most forgotten — following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hallmark of Friendster’s launch in 2002</a>. A year later, LinkedIn was launched as the “more sober,” business-oriented network offering. MySpace — “once the perennial favorite” also launched in 2003. Then, in 2004, TheFacebook.com launched within Harvard University as a means for students to “<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/" data-href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">search for others in their courses, social organizations and Houses</a>.” Almost immediately (just six days later,) the service’s extensive legal history began when three fellow Harvard students accused founder Mark Zuckerberg of “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3" data-href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com</a>.”</p>
<p name="2891" id="2891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is difficult to find an examination of Facebook’s commercial success from a critical perspective among technology media that has almost entirely embedded itself within the industry it claims to keep in cheque. The vast majority of technology press organizations are based in either Silicon Valley or New York City. The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Digital Trends</em> article I have just cited heavily from goes on to suggest that it’s a “universal agreement” that “Facebook promotes both honesty and openness,” when an examination of the discourse surrounding Facebook outside of technology culture suggests otherwise. Much of the related literature from academia surrounds the company’s perceived mishandling of “Big Data” and a broad discussion of “privacy” and its perceived new meaning.</p>
<h3 name="a5bd" id="a5bd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Facebook’s Fallout</h3>
<p name="6730" id="6730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Since the “Cambridge Analytica scandal,” legal attention toward Facebook has become popularized in conversation, so the dissemination of related details is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>
<h4 name="4f80" id="4f80" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Pro-Transparency Within Facebook Inc.</h4>
<p name="d9fa" id="d9fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Facebook, Inc. claims to have made a significant effort to become more transparent, especially since Mark Zuckerberg began appearing in front of special senate judiciary committee hearings in 2017. “Facebook Open Source” publishes regular content on <a href="https://opensource.facebook.com/" data-href="https://opensource.facebook.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opensource.facebook.com</a>, including a podcast called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Diff</em>. In its inaugural episode, entitled “<a href="https://thediffpodcast.com/docs/episode-1" data-href="https://thediffpodcast.com/docs/episode-1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Inside Facebook Open Source</a>,” the intercompany title “Developer Advocate” is explained, along with an anecdote on the origins of Open Source within the company, begun by host Joel Marcey:</p>
<blockquote name="94dc" id="94dc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Many people know that Facebook was developed in a dorm room by Mark Zuckerberg on a stack of LAMPP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, so from the beginning Facebook has had Open Source in its culture.</blockquote>
<p name="af77" id="af77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When asked how Facebook determines when to open-source a project, guest and Developer Advocate Eric Nakagawa makes no mention of transparency, instead leaning entirely on the narrative of Facebook as an organization that seeks to improve the world:</p>
<blockquote name="5b0b" id="5b0b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">One of the reasons we have for open-sourcing a project is it’s gonna make something better. It’s gonna improve either something in the industry — it might be a new, novel approach to solving a problem… Something that we built internally and want to share with the world.</blockquote>

<p name="747f" id="747f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A documented history of Federated social networks is lacking, but a 2017 report by MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative entitled “<a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb" data-href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Defending Internet Freedom Through Decentralization</a>” offers the most comprehensive review I was able to find on the subject. Theirs begins with the invention of a hardware project by “open Internet activist” Eben Moglen in 2010 “with the aim of shifting away from large, corporate owned server farms to a more community-oriented model for managing communications online,” called Freedom Box, and its relationship with Diaspora, the first federated SNS. The Diaspora project was launched by a group of Moglen’s students at Columbia University, originally intended a “distributed social networking service that addressed consumer privacy concerns by enabling users to host their own content on a friendly community device, like Freedom Box.” This vision depended on Moglen’s heavy emphasis on self-hosted servers as the primary means for users to maintain their privacy, going forward.</p>
<p name="456f" id="456f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">WIRED</em> article citing the study entitled “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/" data-href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decentralized Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>,” Barabas suggests that “most people do not want to run their own web servers or social network nodes.” Diaspora exists today entirely separate of its original creators after its “young leaders” faltered under pressure from investor pressure to “’pivot’ the project to a more sustainable business model,” now in the hands of “the open source community.” As of November 2020, ~76000 total users were registered on Diaspora instances (called “nodes” by the community,) with approximately 17000 active in the past month.</p>

<p name="bf2d" id="bf2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Since 2017, the relationship between Mastodon and Twitter has exhibited a complete role reversal in key feature additions. While almost all of the articles and essays on the subject are keen to point out that <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/" data-href="https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eugen Rochko modeled Tootsuite’s original UI after Tweetdeck</a> (now an optional selection called “Advanced UI,”) the “mimicry” between the donor-funded, Open Source platform headed by a single German developer in his twenties and the 15-year-old for-profit social network maintained by a company with nearly 5000 employees shifts in the other direction upon close examination of specific featuresets. Just five months after Mastodon’s first penetration of the mainstream tech conversation in April of 2017 — with its default 500-character post limit and support for up to 5000 — Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html" data-href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced its upcoming expansion from 140 to 280 characters</a>. In October, 2017, with <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/" data-href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon’s second version release</a>, support for image descriptions (alt text) for the sake of accessibility was introduced. While Twitter had long supported similar metadata in images, it did not do so on its main web interface (twitter.com,) Tweetdeck, nor its mobile apps until <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392" data-href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 27th of this year</a>.</p>
<p name="1b88" id="1b88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many Mastodon instance administrators and invested users had added feature requests on the platform’s GitHub repository for media posts to support audio playback intermittently throughout its development history, but Rochko initially resisted out of fears that allowing users to share audio files in posts would lead to Mastodon being “<a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213" data-href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">branded as a pirate music sharing service, and [their] project would end up getting blocked in search results</a>.” Feedback would appear to have pressured him into giving in to this decision, as audio file uploads were quietly allowed in <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1" data-href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Version 2.9.1 of the platform</a>, released on June 22, 2019.</p>
<p name="5f0f" id="5f0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Almost exactly one year later, Twitter first <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html" data-href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced testing for “Voice Tweets” on June 17, 2020</a>, which would not allow audio file upload but instead restrict users to recording within the Twitter mobile app in 140 second-long segments. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controversy ensued</a> regarding Twitter’s omission of any efforts to transcribe Voice Tweets, further catalyzed by the subsequent discovery that the company did not have an internal team dedicated to accessibility.</p>
<p name="4247" id="4247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is still not known at the time of this writing whether or not Voice Tweets have been fully “rolled out” to all eligible Twitter clients, but Mastodon’s latest <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/" data-href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Version 3.2 release</a> from August 2020 included an extensive rework of audio players in posts:</p>
<blockquote name="70e5" id="70e5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.</blockquote>
<p name="0240" id="0240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">These features are hardly comparable except for their common disuse. Data regarding status type is no longer publicly accessible for either platform, but my personal experience as a heavy user of both suggests that audio posts are generally not a priority.</p>
<p name="939a" id="939a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the most popular laments of Twitter users for virtually its entire history surrounds the inability to edit Tweets after they have been posted. When I <a href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview" data-href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interviewed Eugen Rochko in 2017</a>, he explained the central issue with implementing such a capability from his perspective:</p>
<blockquote name="a7a1" id="a7a1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">That won’t happen. There’s actually a good reason why they don’t do that. It’s for the very simple reason that you could make a Toot about one thing, have lots of people favorite share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly it says “heil Hitler,” or whatever.</blockquote>
<p name="1e19" id="1e19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">Instead of live editing a specific status update, <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/" data-href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon’s Summer 2018 response to the issue</a> — called “Delete &amp; Re-Draft” — allows the user to edit the contents of a post in the compose interface immediately following its deletion, so that no information need be revised while live on the network. Rumors and bugs have contributed to an extensive mythos surrounding editable statuses in Twitter’s case, but CEO Jack Dorsey did explicitly address the possibility in <a href="https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU" data-href="https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Q&amp;A published by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">WIRED</em></a> in January 2020, saying, simply, “we’ll probably never do it.”</p>

<h2 id="very-possibly-the-best-dictionary-app-on-the-platform">Very possibly the best dictionary app on the platform.</h2>
<p>Depending on your purpose for a dictionary app, this is the best one on iOS. I use mine to both look up established words <em>and</em> store words I’ve “created.” A lot of the words I want to store come from <a href="https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks" title="HaggardHawks' Twitter Profile">@HaggardHawks on Twitter</a>, and most of them are both 1.) actual words, often from history and 2.) not in any established dictionaries.</p>
<p>These do not show up in apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448" title="LookUp on the App Store">LookUp</a>, which will leave you plumb out of luck. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859" title="Terminology Dictionary on the App Store">Terminology</a>, however, lets me store definitions/other information for “new” words via its “notes” function. To be honest, I can’t imagine moving through life and <em>not</em> creating my own words from time to time, but I understand we’re all different.</p>
<p>If you’re a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471" title="Drafts for iOS/iPadOS on the App Store">Drafts</a> user, I would consider Terminology an absolute must-have. It took me five minutes to establish actions on both apps which allow me to lookup selected words with a keyboard shortcut <code>^⇧D</code> from the former instantly in the latter and - with a single tap - return definitions, synonyms, and antonyms to a new draft. It’s wonderful, absolutely indispensable, and fun!</p>

<p>As developer Anders Borum originated professional-grade git integration on iOS with Working Copy, which remains unmatched, Secure Shellfish remains the reference standard for remote filesystem access across the board on this platform, despite how many competitors have arisen since its introduction.</p>
<p>I must admit: I overlooked Secure Shellfish for years and I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why. I&rsquo;m glad that ended last year, though, as I&rsquo;ve actually since acquired a fair amount of remote file management in my day-to-day working life. Shellfish&rsquo;s magic isn&rsquo;t necessarily obvious, but I promise you it is worth finding out, and what may at first glance look like a somewhat disjointed series of functions actually comes together to form an absolutely irreplaceable application.</p>

<p>There are now quite a few terminal emulator-esque apps on the App Store, but I&rsquo;ve been using a-Shell since it was joined only by Blink (from which it was forked) and iSH. As it was then, a-Shell remains the only one of these with which one can actually accomplish command line tasks <em>locally</em> beyond screwing around. I am ultimately not a command line native, and I don&rsquo;t have the basic theory beneath my use of Python scripts, yet I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish startlingly powerful things within this app, thanks in large part to gracious and immediately-available support via the project&rsquo;s Discord server.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve found yourself here by way of a Siri Shortcut&rsquo;s requirement, I would encourage you to take the time to investigate the commands said shortcut(s) run - try running them yourself!</p>

<p>I know a lot of the reviews here express discontentment with TextExpander’s support on iOS. I hear that, but - as a Bear and Drafts user - I rarely encounter this as a limitation. I also use an external keyboard with my iPhone, though, which makes calling the TextExpander keyboard anywhere else somewhat inconvenient. (Keyboard switching is done with the function key, if you were wondering.)</p>
<p>From what I understand, though, TextExpander’s SDK is quite easy to implement, so it’s also a question of other developers acknowledging that it’s a worthwhile and desired addition to their applications.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’ve seen it mentioned here, but the native iOS/iPadOS/AND macOS feature now entitled “Text Replacement” is certainly worthwhile for anyone looking for something like TextExpander. It can easily be made to function quite similarly.</p>

<p>I've spent more cumulative time playing with my Obsidian configuration in the past 24 hour hours than the sum of the whole I'd spent doing so in the 3(?) years since I installed beta (or was it alpha?) one. While I still find it <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8vkBuYJOz8">janky as hell</a> and deeply untrustworthy – among far too many other woes – I must admit that the bulk of shear hype surrounding its existence has indeed resulted in enough developer attention to achieve some technically interesting capabilities. Naturally, most of these feel absurdly redundant in context and <em>all</em> rely on age-old dependencies, but... well, today I uploaded the text of my almost five-year-old Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 Review to <a href="https://archive.org/details/microsoft-surface-laptop-2">its own dedicated Archive.org page</a> in <em>thirteen</em> different formats rendered using Obsidian's (desktop-only) <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-pandoc">Pandoc integration</a>!</p>
<p>I lambaste with the sincere intent, at least, of being genuinely constructive, and I began upon this post hoping to do so <em>and</em> finally get around to highlighting one of Drafts' most essential (and taken for granted, I suspect) powers in its entirely cross-platform, system-level integration with Mail on Apple Platforms.</p>
<p>One of Drafts' most immediately apparent advantages as a <em>native</em> iOS/iPadOS/macOS application is readily found in <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail">its integration with Mail</a>. Though I've personally managed to almost escape my twenties having yet to endure an email-heavy job, I still find the practice of sending topical/sacred information to myself to be the upmost reliable and direct means of retrieving it.</p>
<p>As I've configured it, within Drafts on any of its 3 platforms, all I need do is press <code>^M</code> to have the text of the current Draft sent instantly to an iCloud Mail alias I use for such things.</p>

</video>
<p>If I were sending to more folks than just myself on a regular basis, I'd definitely make use of Drafts' <a href="https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail">Mail Action Wizard</a> to help simplify and solidify the process of creating a dedicated action, which almost certainly <em>would not</em> have the <code>Send in Background</code> toggle selected, as demonstrated, for the sake of giving myself a preview of outbound messages to... important folks. For macOS users, there's also a bespoke Catalyst app called <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/misc/mail-assistant">Mail Assistant</a>, which I've yet to try.</p>
<h2 id="formatting" id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>The parameters of <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail">the Mail action step</a> can be filled with any combination of items from <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/drafts-templates">the original Drafts template tags array</a> <em>or</em> from the relatively new set of <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/mustache.html">mustache template tags</a>.</p>

If you'd like, you can wrap the [body] tag (or any part of the message, actually) in double %s and select the <code>Send as HTML</code> toggle to have the result rendered as HTML.

<p>If – like me – you're an iCloud Mail user primarily from iOS/iPadOS, here's how to create an iCloud Mail rule for messages you've sent yourself from Drafts:</p>
<ol><li>Visit <a href="https://www.icloud.com/mail/">iCloud.com/mail</a> in your web browser and authenticate.</li>
<li>Open the Rules settings menu by tapping the gear icon in the upper left ⇨ Preferences ⇨ Rules.</li>
<li>Create a new rule with the “Add rule” link.</li>
<li>By default, the “If a message...” field selection should be “is from.” In the text entry field, enter <code>drafts-mail@drafts5.agiletortoise.com</code>.</li>
<li>By default, the “Then...” field selection is “Move to Folder.” I have personally set mine to “Move to Folder and Mark as Read,” but this depends on your preference. Select a folder or mailbox for Drafts messages to be moved to and click “Add.”</li></ol>
<h2 id="publishing-via-email" id="publishing-via-email">Publishing via Email</h2>
<p>I've spent a lot of time this year working on integrating Drafts with <a href="https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities">NeoCities</a>, <a href="https://bilge.world/automating-writeas-posts">Write.as</a>, and other publishing services, but – for new users, especially – Drafts' mail integration offers a pathway to publishing with virtually zero configuration for those services who still offer mail-to-save/post email addresses. These include <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/post-by-email/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/154172?hl=en#:~:text=Click Save.-,to post by email:,-Important: Anyone who">Blogger</a>, <a href="https://howto.write.as/publish-via-email">Write.as</a>, <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/support/faq/187.html">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050995914">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/create-entries-with-email/">Day One</a>, <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2908262/">Things</a>, <a href="https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/email-tasks-into-todoist">Todoist</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest method of setting this up would involve finding your private email address for a given service(s), pasting them in the aforementioned <a href="https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail">Mail Action Wizard</a>, titling the action by the name of the service, and installing. There's also an <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Mr">Email to Myself action</a> on the Drafts Action Directory to get you started.</p>

<p>Going the other direction, users of Apple Mail (the client) might find it pleasantly surprising that one can drag a message from Mail into Drafts in order to automatically create a markdown-formatted hyperlink that opens said message from anywhere.</p>

<p>As I touched on in <a href="https://bilge.world/2021">my 2021 overview of <em>The Psalms</em></a>, this blog has undergone some very significant – and mostly involuntary – changes of late. This summer has abruptly brought some life happens which will inevitably contribute further changes to a degree that warrants a very bloggy sort of Update Post.</p>
<p>Most importantly, perhaps, is that I've found myself with a real, tangible, full-time Big Boy job as a nighttime custodian of <em>my actual elementary school</em>. Though I suppose it's never been revealed before, here, I actually love cleaning and love this school, particularly, so I'm more excited than I've ever been for any sort of documentable employment, but this means I will imminently be transitioning from a lifestyle with virtually zero time-bound obligations to working 3-11:15PM, Monday through Friday. Undoubtedly, this will have a profound effect on my <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1542999255497023489">recently-announced</a> <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/services">consultancy business</a>, but I'll be making an effort to formally update the adjacent Fantastical Openings links with revised availability.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Kxyy5PxB.jpeg" alt="iPad Media Center"/></p>
<p>Adjacent to this news are the experiences I've had in the past few weeks helping a friend ready her third-grade, public school classroom, which have been particularly enlightening with regard to the extent that iPads have been integrated into the education of young children in this country. Some highlights from this discovery (in this particular, Title I Midwestern elementary school):</p>
<ul><li>Every child will receive a 5th-generation, WiFi-only iPad (<a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/specs/apple-ipad-9-7-inch-early-2017-wi-fi-only-specs.html">iPad6,11</a>) which they will be able to take home over the course of the school year.</li>
<li>The district paid $299 per unit for said iPads, a mere $30 off their full retail price for the rest of us, $329.</li>
<li>The random device I picked up from the pile shown in the images embedded above had not been updated beyond iPadOS 15 (since March of this year.)</li>
<li>Responsibility for the maintenance, setup, and deployment of said iPads rests entirely on a single individual, who is also responsible for the “media center” (what many of us know as the <em>Library</em>.)</li>
<li>Responsibility for ongoing hardware considerations (charging and storage) is left entirely to individual teachers.</li>
<li>Net contributions from Apple, Inc. to this new aspect of childhood education reside some six or seven figures <em>in the negative</em>.</li></ul>
<p>In the two weeks preceding our district's start date, I had the painful opportunity to tour some of my friend's colleagues' storage solutions for their student iPads. The image below is the one I chose to append to my appeal to the <em>MacStories</em> Discord, attempting to <em>leverage</em> workspace-obsessed yuppies' knowledge for the benefit of public education.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1o0iA322.png" alt="Sad iPad Rack"/></p>
<p>There were a few helpful replies, which made it clear that organizations with actual budgets for device storage have gravitated toward rolling carts.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've been made intimately aware just how integral YouTube has become in public education, these past few weeks. believe it or not, there is not a program – to the educators I've spoken to's knowledge, anyway – that removes advertising from YouTube playback in this case.</p>— ⓓⓐⓥⓘⓓ ⓑⓛⓤⓔ (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1565127670345744388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2022</a></blockquote> </p>
<h2 id="going-forward" id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>
<p>The time I haven't spent in this medium has been redirected toward a few key sources. <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue">My Raindrop collections</a> have continued to grow, including a particular one I'd like to highlight here, called <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/blessed-web-utilities-13380122">Blessed Web Utilities</a>.</p>

<p>With its new ownership, I've continued to pour more and more energy into Siri Shortcuts published <a href="https://routinehub.co/user/blue">on RoutineHub</a>. I'm proud to have been asked to participate directly in the platform's upcoming aggregatory efforts. I've also established a reliable habit of sharing Shortcuts documentation/source files on <a href="https://t.me/s/extratone">the extratone Telegram channel</a>, among many other aspects of my ongoing Online Life.</p>
<p>I've also restarted an <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/1C547BA9-D29F-4F2E-8B24-3F5872D329B6.html"><em>Extratone</em>-era habit</a> of using redirects to simultaneously simplify and index topical URLs to both my own projects and external resources. My <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/redirection">new, NeoCities-bound Redirection Index</a> should be a robust way to keep up with David Blue, Online, therefore.</p>
<p>As always, I hope you'll freely <a href="https://gist.github.com/extratone/7118e115b200f19d577dfe6a330d898f/raw/790cd2ec3cdd160a462abb1caf443315ca8b91f3/davidblue.vcf">contact me</a> with comments/suggestions/feedback/rants/etc. As for this particular feed, I doubt there will be much noticeable change from its status quo in the past ~two years.</p>

<p>Though I don't believe I've ever discussed it, here, the continuance of the fandom for Houston music legend, DJ Screw, on into the 21st century is an issue I remain very invested in. I doubt you want to hear much about it, but the issue of actually <em>obtaining audio files</em> from the Screw collection is a worthwhile one to engage for context's sake. I was first introduced to the ~343-chapter collection by my high school best friend, who'd acquired it via an ancient Pirate Bay torrent some hero set up in the early 2000s[^1]. It was complete – probably – and more or less correctly organized <em>by chapter</em>, but that's about it as far as reliable metadata was concerned. The results one would find elsewhere on the web, from <a href="https://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=keyword:dj+screw">sites like DatPiff</a>, were hardly any better – many, in fact, were obviously sourced from that same torrent.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/WB5CXuSz.png" alt="DJ Screw on the iTunes Store and Apple Music"/></p>
<p><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709?itsct=music_box_badge&itscg=30200&app=music&ls=1" style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;"><img src="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/listen-on-apple-music/badge/en-us?size=250x83&h=cdbcefe9e23b0310ab61b31e72e2dcdb" alt="Listen on Apple Music" style="border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;"></a></p>
<p>In the interim, a lot has changed about music consumption. You know this, but – as you might've already imagined – none of the mainstream services you fuckers partake in have managed to do Robert Earl Davis III justice in the modern era. <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TC6ZeVdvCuBSn32h5Msul">Spotify</a>, both, will send you in neatly identical spirals pretty much regardless which of their pet vectors you choose to populate with His Name. As much as I've vouched for the former, it's perhaps the worst of them all in this context – departing the marque entirely into the (respectable but... incorrect) world of non-Davis <em>SLOWED 'n” THOWED</em>[^2] almost immediately.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day, I'll find it within myself to tackle this issue – DJ Screw in the Щ́̇͋ͯ̋̅Σ̾̒͋ͯͭ ̊ᄂ̋̈͐İͬV̏̆̊͛̍̌Σ̆ͣͣͭ͐ͫ̆̊ ͪͬ̿̈́̑ͤ̚IͫП̎̿͑ͦ͆̚ ͣͫ͌ͨ̈Λ̃͛̓ͦͪ͒̑̽ ͛̑ͤ͊ͭƬ̒I̅͌̊̑ͧͪM̈́̓Σ̋̏͂͐͊͆ͣ, generally – but I actually have extremely wonderful, urgent news. You see, dearest archive.org was actually provided <a href="https://archive.org/details/dj-screw-discography"><strong>the entire, impeccably tagged Discography</strong></a> by actual Culture Heroes some years ago. All of it, accessible in multiple file formats, embeddable, superbly shareable! This is the most important truth I have to impart to you today, really, but – for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, there's even more...</p>
<iframe src="https://archive.org/details/dj-screw-discography&playlist=1&list_height=150" width="500" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<h2 id="automation" id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/K6iHUgs0.png" alt="Download Random Screw Tape Shortcut"/></p>
<p>As of right now, just two Siri Shortcuts – <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12610"><strong>Download Random Screw Tape</strong></a> and <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12618"><strong>DJ Screw Discography</strong></a>[^3]. The first is perhaps the most delightful – if all goes well, running it right out of the box should result in a random tape from the library downloaded in a folder of your specification (at install,) as well <em>actual playback</em>, in correct order, within the shortcut, itself.</p>
<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9v_oc7GmvvM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9v_oc7GmvvM&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9v_oc7GmvvM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>This is magic, yes, but the second is <em>true power</em>. After picking folders at installation for 1) downloaded archive.org-sourced .zip files to live in temporarily before they are extracted and deleted and 2) your complete, correctly metatagged DJ Screw Tape library could – in theory, anyway – magically appear in a single, undoubtedly several hours-long run. I have yet to actually test the full bit myself, technically, but I can advise you to set Auto-Lock (<code>Settings ⇨ Display & Brightness ⇨ Auto-Lock</code>) to <code>Never</code>, make sure you leave the Shortcut open within the Shortcuts App, itself, and give it a shot, if possible.</p>

<p>This past month, <em>MacStories</em> hosted a community Siri Shortcuts contest called <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-automation-april/"><em>Automation April</em></a>. One of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners">its winners</a> – a shortcut called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/68b1d8edadb9446599c90d988ef21eb3">What's on KUTX</a>?” credited to Jack Wellborn – caught my eye as a lifelong dependent upon National Public Radio. Via <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners/#whats-on-kutx-a-music-discovery-shortcut">John Voorhees' comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The solution Wellborn came up with is ingenious. It turns out that KUTX uses a web API that can return information about the currently playing track. The API is used to drive an ‘On Now’ widget on the station’s website, but Wellborn discovered that they could query the API and get the track information back as JSON. So, they built a shortcut that queries the API when run, returning the info about the currently-playing song.</p></blockquote>
<p>I began playing around with <a href="https://api.composer.nprstations.org">the NPR API</a> Jack used and discovered quite accidentally that their shortcut could be modified to display current <em>program</em> information for those NPR stations that are <em>not</em> music-oriented, like mine. For the vast majority of the 24-hour cycle, <a href="https://www.kbia.org/about">KBIA</a> – “Mid-Missouri's NPR station” – plays news programs, mostly from NPR, itself, supplanted by BBC news late at night.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey locals!

<p>After some trimming and the addition of the URL for KBIA's <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/station/npr-news-kbia-mid-missouri/ra.870744176">Apple Music Stream</a>, I came up with <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/04ec61d2f057497bba899eb434b3da07"><strong>What's on KBIA?</strong></a>, which displays upon run the current program's title as well as a hyperlink to open its distinct webpage. By way of a simple <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/choose-from-menu/">Choose from Menu</a> action, it then prompts one with three options:</p>
<ol><li>Open the program's webpage (again.)</li>
<li>Open KBIA's stream in Apple Music.</li>
<li>Open KOPN's stream in Apple Music. (<a href="https://www.kopn.org">KOPN</a> is Columbia's community radio station.)</li></ol>

<h2 id="creating-a-shortcut-for-your-npr-station" id="creating-a-shortcut-for-your-npr-station">Creating a Shortcut for <em>Your</em> NPR Station</h2>
<p>All I really needed to customize Jack Wellborn's original shortcut was my NPR station's “UCSID,“which, for reference, is <code>5387648fe1c8335046a1d4b4</code>. Upon installation of my <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12143"><strong>What's on NPR?</strong></a> shortcut, you'll be prompted to specify this. Unfortunately, retrieving it via NPR's API requires special authorization, for some reason, but – since we're retrieving data from an NPR station's playback widget already configured to use the API – it's actually as easy as opening your browser's “Dev Tools” or showing on your given station's homepage. If you're unfamiliar, <a href="https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/">here's a handy guide</a> to doing so on some popular desktop web browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web-inspector/id1584825745"><img src="https://i.snap.as/6dahYnnY.png" alt="Web Inspector" width="30%"></img></a></p>
<p>Honestly, though, if you're already on your iOS/iPadOS device and you're willing to install a single, free Safari Extension, I believe you'll find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web-inspector/id1584825745">Web Inspector</a> to be the single, simplest method of retrieving your station's UCSID.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/r1VgmbNv.png" alt="Finding UCSID-Web Inspector"/></p>
<h3 id="finding-your-station-s-ucsid-with-web-inspector" id="finding-your-station-s-ucsid-with-web-inspector">Finding your station's UCSID with Web Inspector</h3>
<ol><li>Navigate to your station's homepage (ex. <code>kbia.org</code>.)</li>
<li>Start playback of the live stream you'd like to query (may or may not be necessary, depending.)</li>
<li>Open Web Inspector via the <a href="https://i.snap.as/2632HFBC.png">Safari Extensions Menu</a>.</li>
<li>In the <code>DOM</code> tab, use the search icon to filter for <code>ucsid</code>.</li>
<li>Your station's UCSID is the value for the <code>data-stream-ucsid</code> field.</li></ol>
<p>Depending on how modern your station's website is (I think – I'm supposing, here,) you may or may not find this field. For reference, <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/shortcuts/kbia/example.txt">here is the HTML source of KBIA's webpage</a> from which I drew in its entirety. If you're having trouble, please feel free to <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf">contact me</a> however you wish, ideally with your preferred station's identifier/web url.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/broadcasts/id1469995354"><img src="https://i.snap.as/e68mJ9cQ.png" alt="Broadcasts" width="30%"></img></a></p>
<h3 id="integration-with-the-broadcasts-app" id="integration-with-the-broadcasts-app">“Integration” with the Broadcasts app</h3>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/broadcasts/id1469995354"><strong>Broadcasts</strong></a> is a very popular and highly-praised universal Apple application for internet radio streaming. By default, my What's on NPR? shortcut includes an action to begin streaming a station in Broadcasts, but it requires further configuration.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eTkiNc6O.png" alt="Broadcasts App Integration"/></p>
<p>In all likelihood, a search of the <a href="https://i.snap.as/OvItUZSE.png">Broadcasts Directory</a> for your station's four-letter identifier should yield results. Once you've added your station to your library in Broadcasts, hold its icon (or <code>^ Tap</code>) to present the context menu (shown in the screenshots embedded above) and select <code>Edit</code>. The exact value for the <code>Name</code> field in configuration menu that results must be supplied as the answer to the second configuration step of my What's on NPR? shortcut. If you do not wish to use Broadcasts, you need only delete or replace its single action in the shortcut's default configuration.</p>
<p>If you've followed along this far, you now have both values you're prompted for at installation of said shortcut, by default: your station's <code>ucsid</code> and its name in the Broadcasts app. You need only continue if you'd prefer to add options for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390">Apple Music</a> and/or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962">VLC</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jeNMtNgs.png" alt="Finding an NPR Station's Apple Music URL"/></p>
<h3 id="integration-with-apple-music" id="integration-with-apple-music">“Integration” with Apple Music</h3>
<p>If you'd like to have a menu option to begin streaming your NPR station in Apple Music, begin by searching within the app for your station's identifier (as shown in the screenshot embedded above.) Use the triple-dot menu's <code>Share Station</code> option to copy its Apple Music URL. (WBEZ's, for example, is <code>https://music.apple.com/us/station/npr-news-wbez-chicago/ra.872998937</code>.) Replace or append to the Broadcasts option with a menu option pointing to an <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/open-urls/">Open URLs</a> action containing the resulting URL. (Refer to <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/04ec61d2f057497bba899eb434b3da07">my What's on KBIA? shortcut</a> to see this implemented.)</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962"><img src="https://i.snap.as/RZYRoIw8.png" alt="VLC" width="30%"></img></a></p>
<h3 id="integration-with-vlc-media-player" id="integration-with-vlc-media-player">“Integration” with VLC media player</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962"><strong>VLC media player</strong></a> iOS app does not yet have its own Siri Shortcuts actions, but it <em>does</em> have a handy URL scheme which allows one to stream or download the contents of any raw media URL. Using Web Inspector as described above, I was able to find the raw stream URL for KBIA (<code>https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/KBIAFM.mp3</code>) quite quickly in the <code>Resources</code> tab whilst streaming live.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/R5o3kda5.png" alt="Finding Raw Stream URL-Web Inspector"/></p>
<p>To add an option to my shortcut to open the stream in VLC, I would add the following value in an Open URLs action:</p>
<pre><code>vlc-x-callback://x-callback-url/stream?url=https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/KBIAFM.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, if you have any trouble configuring What's on NPR? – whether that be with finding your station's UCSID and/or “integrating” playback with another app, please do <a href="https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf">reach out</a>.</p>

<p><audio controls="">
  <source src="https://davidblue.wtf/audio/blink.m4a">
</audio></p>
<p>I was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story – documented in <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">a Medium post</a> by <em>WIRED</em> Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford – until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line – a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png" alt="iSH Shell and a-Shell"/></p>
<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306"><strong>Blink Shell & Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png" alt="bbj Out"/></p>
<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href="https://blink.sh">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href="https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for – “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png" alt="Apreche Reply"/></p>
<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community – a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href="https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136">public pages</a> – exclusively through <a href="https://github.com/extratone/jorts">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this – note <a href="https://tilde.town/~apreche">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above – but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png" alt="Blink Settings"/></p>
<h2 id="locally" id="locally">Locally</h2>
<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/fonts">fonts</a> or <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes">themes</a> – you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js">CLRS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js">Man Page</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png" alt="Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage"/></p>
<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png" alt="Repository Cleaning"/></p>
<p>Linking <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>

<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>

<p>Blink’s own “<a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>

<h3 id="keyboarding" id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h3>
<p>To its credit, I think <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>
<p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af">O P E N</a>.” Or – in the case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png" alt="Blink Custom Key Presses"/></p>
<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png" alt="Importing Keys in Blink Shell"/></p>
<h2 id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh" id="remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>
<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png" alt="Blink Autocomplete"/></p>
<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png" alt="Adding Files App Locations in Blink"/></p>
<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png" alt="Blink File Providers"/></p>

<h2 id="chat" id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat</a> and – especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href="https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>
<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,
  “AltitudeRef” : 0,
  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,
  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,
  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,
  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,
  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,
  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,
  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,
  “DOP” : 35
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href="http://limechat.net/iphone/">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>
<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>
<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>
<h4 id="weechat-configuration" id="weechat-configuration">WeeChat Configuration</h4>
<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href="https://tilde.town/~m455">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>
<ul><li><code>fset</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>
<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>
<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "%M"</code></li></ul>
<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FhjqlFV1.png" alt="Spacedust Chat-Minimal"/></p>
<p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.</p>

<h2 id="town-television" id="town-television">Town Television</h2>
<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png" alt="Blink Appearance Settings"/></p>
<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png" alt="Notifications in Blink"/></p>
<h2 id="other-considerations" id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>
<p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&cmd=</code> – but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above – and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>
<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>
<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown <a href="https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup">here</a> and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307">here</a>.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding a shortcut I posted on RoutineHub a few days ago entitled “<a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11143"><strong>Generate Shortcuts Run Links List</strong></a>,” so I thought I’d attempt to overview how I’ve come to use Shortcuts’ URL scheme as my primary method of calling shortcuts across both iOS and macOS.</p>
<p>The basis of the whole shit is <code>shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=</code> and <code>shortcuts://x-callback-url/run-shortcut?name=</code>. Using these along with URL-encoded shortcuts titles (for those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my first Dot in Iconfactory’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191">Tot</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155801898-e6c74cee-c26a-458c-a915-c3f969c6f3fd.png" alt="Tot"/></p>
<p>With a few exceptions, all the links you see in the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of these, I typed out by hand with <a href="https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb">a TextExpander snippet</a>. Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:</p>

<p>I had a bit of an issue creating the shortcut, itself. Though Shortcuts includes a native <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/url-encode/">URL Encode action</a>, I couldn’t seem to get it to reliably generate URL-encoded shortcuts names, which is why I inserted the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1492174677">Text Case</a> action, instead.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-review-of-apple-inc-s-first-venture-as-a-textile-company" id="a-quick-review-of-apple-inc-s-first-venture-as-a-textile-company">A quick review of Apple, Inc’s first venture as a textile company.</h2>
<p>Now that Apple, Incorporated is a textile company, I thought it might be pertinent of me – someone with incredibly filthy hands – to review its first textile product, the Rag. Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. <em>It’s not good for it</em>, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251502745">Oleophobic coating</a> away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.</p>
<p>What’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected"><em>Connected</em></a>[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how <em>sparsely</em> Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question <a href="https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/836622115880828961/947175164800565248">in the <em>MacStories</em> Discord</a> to only a single response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that's only when I really notice the screen being dirty.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155851075-a933d702-8fd0-480d-aaae-a4322d2e46a6.jpeg" alt="Rag on Couch"/></p>
<h2 id="methodology" id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I must admit – it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning <em>truly</em> grubby surfaces.

<p>I would advise a strong, rotational approach under moderate pressure when using the Rag on your device’s screen. I would not advise you use it on your face or hands. I also would not advise you use it to clean your dog’s paws after a muddy bout. More reasonably, it’s not even all that great for cleaning glasses lenses. (It might just be that mine are particularly dirty.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It sounds a bit silly, but $20 is actually a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single microfiber cloth. I’d link you alternatives, but I’m committed to never sharing Amazon links on this here blog. For what it’s worth, the Apple Rag appears to have a strong resistance to liquids (they just fall off,) and a truly unique competency at cleaning glass screens.</p>

    <p>calling her mom is like... the only even remotely reasonable outcome, btw. she *is* a mom several times over, now. and 46.</p>
    <p>and by "crush," i mean... at least 30% of my total cumulative mental energy was spent repeating "I am so in love with Sienna Guillory" for *years.*<br />
<br />
imagine telling that person "one day, you're gonna wish her happy mother's day every year in a text box. she will call you 'bub.'"</p>

<figure name="1089" id="1089" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*N6wp2_cE64XXfB5x.jpeg" data-width="880" data-height="660" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*N6wp2_cE64XXfB5x.jpeg"></figure><p name="39db" id="39db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When I graduated high school in the Spring of 2012, my mom offered me a choice: I could go to Community College with a new laptop, or a new iPhone. I was still on the kick that’d started with my first-generation iPhone, four years earlier, and decided to take the bet. Instead of a new laptop, I entered my first vaguely-collegiate experience armed with an iPhone 4S and an original Magic Keyboard, beginning an experiment that’s more-or-less ongoing (there have been intermittent pauses, notably.)</p>
<p name="eff5" id="eff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the years since, I have accumulated a lot of evidence to suggest that number of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">iPhone</em> users who’ve used a hardware keyboard with their phone is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extremely</em> tiny (which I believe to be entirely reasonable and inevitable,) but I think also believe it’s a dynamic that’s still worth documenting properly. Frankly, I can say definitively that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it absolutely has not been</strong>, thus far.</p>
<p name="7d97" id="7d97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you may have observed, even the association of iPad and keyboard in the past few years has actually made it worse — lookup any given iOS app’s keyboard shortcuts and you’ll return a list <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">for iPad</em> and nothing else. Over the years, I’ve maintained a habit of going down the iPad list, testing each shortcut on iPhone, noting down which of the iPad shortcuts respond on the latter in a table, and then emailing said list to the app’s developers. (Naturally, they almost never respond. Shout out to <a href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review" data-href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tapbots</a> for being the only recent exception.) After refocusing the bulk of my attention back on iOS and its adjacent communities, this year, I’ve looked around and come to a conclusion: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">if ever there is going to be a consolidate reference for those who regularly use a bluetooth keyboard with their iPhones, I am going to have to write it, myself</strong>.</p>
<p name="a2b7" id="a2b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently, my end target draws influence from the ebooks published by the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">MacStories</em> team — like <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/" data-href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tim Nahmuck’s Drafts 5 “Review”</a> (which is closer to a User Manual than an App Review) — but it’s most important that it be in the form(s) which add maximum value to readers/users. In that vein, I must acknowledge that I cannot accomplish it entirely on my own, yet am fairly inexperienced with the sort of collaboration I’d imagine will be involved.</p>

On macOS, there really aren’t any equivalents at all.</p>
<p>For someone like me - who uses Textcraft’s transformations both recreationally/socially and has used them in development-ish tasks - its $4.99 and featherweight 3.7 MB were/are more than worth the experience. It’s super configurable, capable, and robust.</p>

<p name="fdbe" id="fdbe" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“While streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our taste, or at least to our browsing history,” Krukowski goes on to note, “the business of it is in fact closer to one-size-fits-all.” Clearly, this is an issue, but technically <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">only insofar as Spotify advertises itself as a means to discover new music</strong>, which <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/" data-href="https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it does consistently</a>.</p>
<p name="7ec3" id="7ec3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The New Yorker</em>’s Alex Ross in a widely-read review of “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed" data-href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music</a>,” a new book by University of Oslo professor Kyle Devine, entitled “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music" data-href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Hidden Costs of Streaming Music</a>.” Ross first cites a statement by Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, “The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans,” arguing the true meaning of his words to be “to make a living as a musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking hour.” His most original (as in, yet to be considered in the mainstream discourse) argument, though, involves the service’s environmental impact. He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.”</p>
<blockquote name="2c71" id="2c71" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.</em></blockquote>
<p name="f295" id="f295" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688" data-href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a July article in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Barrons</em></a> quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading this year’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anchor</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Megaphone</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview" data-href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gimlet Media</a>, and — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most controversially</a> — the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property in the medium, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Joe Rogan Experience</em></a>.

<h3 name="cfd7" id="cfd7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Responsible Curation</h3>
<p name="84f2" id="84f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For solutions to address Spotify’s overwhelming skew toward rewarding popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that “<a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/" data-href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half of Spotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly</a>.” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pitchfork</em>’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, all of his examples are male.</p>
<p name="460b" id="460b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fast Company</em> addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination" data-href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spotify’s $30 billion playlist for global domination</a>:”</p>
<blockquote name="8068" id="8068" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are eroding music’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”</em></blockquote>
<p name="be10" id="be10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook — the CEO of the most valuable company in the history of the world — as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy — vague, at best.</p>
<figure name="60cb" id="60cb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/At_K4FVY198?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="ed5d" id="ed5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In <a href="https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/" data-href="https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May</a>, Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists.</p>
<p name="70ef" id="70ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in <a href="http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php" data-href="http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a 2008 interview with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The HTML Times</em></a>, creating an online presence for one’s music had long been “a pain in the ass:”</p>
<blockquote name="9646" id="9646" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.</em></blockquote>
<p name="4f3c" id="4f3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of publishing one’s music as easy as possible. In <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/" data-href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the first post on the company’s blog from September, 2008</a>, Diamond details the results of their engineering:</p>
<blockquote name="9bb3" id="9bb3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.</em></blockquote>
<p name="680b" id="680b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the sincerity in its commitment to artists through programs like “Bandcamp Fridays,” when the service waives its cut of artists’ revenue (ten percent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the company <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/" data-href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">donated a Friday’s share of proceeds to the Transgender Law Center</a> in response to the Presidential Administration’s proposal to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company has repeatedly <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser" data-href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brought back the program</a> in recognition of its impact on independent artists, and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for a specific example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed.</p>
<p name="445f" id="445f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> a profitable company, and has been for nearly a decade. In Dubber’s interview, Diamond explains their financial origins:</p>
<blockquote name="9165" id="9165" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on getting to profitability. So we did that and got there in 2012, and that’s helped us maintain the mission, maintain the vision that we’ve had for the company for a long time.</em></blockquote>
<p name="5b4d" id="5b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Also in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less popular, fringe content, through its online publication the <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com" data-href="https://daily.bandcamp.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bandcamp Daily</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote name="455f" id="455f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The mission of the Daily, it’s our editorial arm, and it’s just to highlight this incredibly diverse world of music that’s on a site where anybody can upload anything. And the result of that is that you have weird subgenres and a lot of music, I think, that wouldn’t necessarily be covered anywhere else.</em></blockquote>
<p name="d5c9" id="d5c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Bandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business models technology companies have been so criticized for upholding and has done so in relative obscurity from the media. In his interview, Dubber asks Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn’t get mentioned in all these press articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own business decisions out of “[his] personal preference:”</p>
<blockquote name="73c4" id="73c4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist promote themselves, and it’s not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.”</em></blockquote>
<p name="56ad" id="56ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tastemaking</em> enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of Collections — which allow listeners to display music they’ve purchased on a customizable web page — and Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator’s Collection to those who follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/about" data-href="https://bandcamp.com/about" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">while helping artists earn $634 million</a> as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp’s success in response to a question from Dubber on the company’s comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis mine:)</p>
<blockquote name="bf99" id="bf99" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
<em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest part of the job because it’s whatever benefits artists the most. Because </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">the way Bandcamp makes money is if artists make a lot more money</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">, so that’s what we try to spend every day doing.</em>
</blockquote>
<p name="2bd9" id="2bd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">The solution to the “debacle” of streaming music, then, is not necessarily charity or socioeconomic revolution. It would seem that all it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music.</p>

<p name="caea" id="caea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For those of us who’ve written about technology, generally, for quite a long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/”ethical” conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an emotional event. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Social Network</em> had an almost comical disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects. Not that it’s particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4" data-href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said in court</a>, essentially, that he didn’t know what the movie was about. I’m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the times</em>, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Social Dilemma</em> could’ve done better, in that regard.</p>
<p name="711d" id="711d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell’s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man’s screen, the film’s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">blatantly false</em> imagery. The Privacy Problem is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ridiculously</em> unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as “ridiculous,” as did one of my favs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Casey Newton</a>:</p>
<blockquote name="4541" id="4541" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.</em></blockquote>

Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Verge</em>’s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">separate</em> tech media — grandmothers, retirees, etc. — who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Social Dilemma</em> and particularly susceptible to its delusions about “privacy” — a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">collection</strong> of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">examination</strong> with human eyes, which — while possible — is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.</p>

Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for “solutions” to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who’ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages — some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization’s website nor the film’s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>

For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin.

Essentially, the evidence suggests that the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">alternatives</em> discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn’t immediately off-putting to “the average person.”</p>

It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world — regardless of what they believe now, or then — that these folks should not be our first call when we’re searching for “solutions.” You know this, they know it, and they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">explicitly acknowledged it</em> at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.</p>

<p name="145f" id="145f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Now, I’ve always considered the ability to change a computer’s name an immense privilege. My first “real” computer’s name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus’ name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that’s completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone’s common name to that of “your favorite television character” (<a href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard" data-href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hildur Odegard</a> is my favorite character in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fortitude</em>, so…) is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it’s just that it’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ridiculously</em> low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down “change device name” as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.</p>

However, the “detox” seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it’s hilarious that I can freely refer to “privacy” as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one’ social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the “Supported by Mozilla Firefox” badges all over the website and asks me “well, what did you expect?” My answer: something “more” than promotion, I suppose.</p>
<p name="ca27" id="ca27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suspect this is another case of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">don’t go to those who created the problem for the solution</em>. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">More privacy</em> is a more tangible vector upon which to “innovate” than simply <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">putting down the fucking phone</em>, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">turn off all your notifications</strong>. I genuinely believe turning off <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all</em> notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I’d somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">years</em>, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who’s notifications I’d probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly.</p>
<p name="db08" id="db08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">turn it off</strong>, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I’d wager.) I suspect it’s long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Email Addiction</strong>” goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR’s greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email’s footer. If you’re <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really</em> serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">do</em> read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform’s archives feature — or don’t — but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you’ll be ready to seek out other <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Email Wellness</em> methodologies like the recently-trendy <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Inbox Zero</em>.</p>
<p name="bbf1" id="bbf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">a set daily time</strong> to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it’s okay to announce on Facebook that you’re taking a break from Facebook. There <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">contact me literally any time</strong>. My personal phone number is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">(573) 823–4380</strong>. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I’ve discovered with you.</p>
<p name="e506" id="e506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My own advice on “privacy:” don’t worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you’re an iOS user, you’ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step — if we’re really honest with ourselves — is figuring out how you’re going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.</p>

			 <div class="card-tweets" dir="auto">
    <p>still working on my post about Facebook. it's over 7500 words now... <br />
<br />
sorry.</p>
    <p>so far, I've used the word "Facebook" 135 times.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty sure I'll have it up before the end of the week. and then I will never have to write about Facebook again...</p>
    <p>10,000 words now... I think I need to take a break. definitely should be able to wrap up, polish, and publish tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I COMPLETELY missed the Twitter hack... guess this means I'm already doing much better about not getting distracted.</p>
    <p>well... I forgot to discuss VK, so it might actually be tomorrow before I get it up... I know hundreds of thousands of you were counting on this essay... I know you've spent three whole days now just refreshing my blog... I'm so sorry.</p>
    <p>update:<br />
so I was just about ready to conclude what I had to say about VK when it occurred to me that I should try searching for the original Russian expression of the word (ВКонта́кте,) which revealed a whole new story...</p>
    <p>turns out, the only conversation about VK in American media, at least, is as a haven for Nazis who've been banned from Facebook. apparently their pilgrimage began around 2016. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/extremist-groups-vkontakte/483426/">theatlantic.com/technology/arc…</a></p>
    <p>this investigation by bellingcat (which is absolutely CHOCK FULL of Nazi imagery - please take care) examines a whole host of neo-Nazis who maintain profiles on both sites, and are just way more explicit about their ideology on VK. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/02/13/vkontakte-vs-facebook-from-open-white-supremacy-to-stealth/">bellingcat.com/news/2020/02/1…</a></p>
    <p>imo, the fact that NONE OF THIS was visible in search results for "VK" and "VKontakte" indicates that search engines are still kindof dumb.</p>
    <p>to be honest, I have no idea what to do now. literally all of the Facebook alternatives I've argued for have an association with terrible people for one reason or another.</p>
    <p>in some cases, it's the fault of the services, I agree. VK should definitely not be allowing some of those fucking images.</p>
    <p>in Mastodon's, though, articles like this really let it down. Gab stole the PLATFORM - the SOFTWARE, not the network. the vast majority of instance admins came together within hours of the announcement to make sure their servers didn't federate with Gab. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb8y3x/the-nazi-free-alternative-to-twitter-is-now-home-to-the-biggest-far-right-social-network">vice.com/en_us/article/…</a></p>
    <p>and yet the headline still uses the term "home." something like this would've been way less misleading: "The Biggest Far-Right Social Network Moves to Nazi-Free Twitter Alternative's Platform."</p>
    <p>very discouraged. as of this moment, retirement looks great.</p>
    <p>here's a draft if you'd like to read it early for whatever reason. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:09296918-52c0-4c21-943e-0b008a305d85">documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?ur…</a></p>
    <p>and here are my notes so far. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/107272441889341440/734563821024444486/David_Blue_vs._Big_Blue_Notes.html">cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/10…</a></p>
    <p>what is the best answer, going forward, to combat the tendency for alt-right, neo-Nazi, and other hateful groups to seek refuge on "alternative social media?"</p>
    <p>well, I took a break from writing about Facebook... to write about why I'm taking a break from writing about Facebook. <a class="entity-url" data-preview="true" href="https://extratone.vivaldi.net/covering-facebook/">extratone.vivaldi.net/covering-faceb…</a></p>
    <p>WELL. I do love the burn in this comment: <br />
"Complaining about how it operates is a little like going to someone’s house party because all the cool people were there and then complaining that the bathroom isn’t ergonomic or you wish their pool was deeper and had a diving board."</p>

<h2 id="with-anima-mundi-vril-departs-from-his-berghain-roots-and-delivers-an-introspective-exploration-of-his-eternal-soul">With <em>Anima Mundi</em>, Vril departs from his Berghain roots and delivers an introspective exploration of his eternal soul.</h2>
<p>If I&rsquo;m allowed to have favorites, I would claim Vril, the German DJ and Resident Advisor Lieutenant, as mine among his genre, which shouldn&rsquo;t mean anything to the longtime techno connoisseur (who should probably find themselves skipping this review and moving on,) but <em>does</em> lend me to evangelize to those who&rsquo;ve been deprived of positive exposure to the culture. Most any electronic music can be transportive and my own affection for it can no doubt be attributed at least in part to my near-total isolation from its community. I have never been to a proper <em>club</em> (the only offering in the setting of my young adulthood has never aspired beyond squishy DJs who are now somehow 100% content describing their scene as &ldquo;EDM,&quot;) and I&rsquo;ve only had a few friends with whom I could share significant interest, though their knowledge was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/MqgJFt7A010">extraordinarily extensive</a>. It takes incisive wisdom to cut through &ldquo;Techno&rdquo; as the misnomer it has become in today&rsquo;s America - a subject deserving its own, more deliberate discussion - but for the moment, let&rsquo;s consider a single record which manages to exemplify the potential of this historically-niche medium.</p>
<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been one hundred percent sure that &ldquo;Vril&rdquo; is a proper noun, but I could very well have gone on living the rest of my life never deciding between <em>whom</em> or <em>where</em>. Up until <em>Anima Mundi</em>&rsquo;s release on October 15th (technically it was released last year, but <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Vril-Anima-Mundi/release/9924870">exclusively on cassette</a>,) his catalog was consistently <em>Vril</em> - on-brand, you might say - though in the most respectable sense for a dance DJ, I&rsquo;d imagine. I can&rsquo;t quite recall the moment of discovery, but I do know that the dozen or so of his live mixes available on Mixcloud caught my attention immediately afterward. There&rsquo;s something magic in the layers that grabs an unnamed rhythmic organ of mine in a way that cannot be expressed in written form without experience I do not have. What I <em>can</em> provide is the most comprehensively concise example I can find: a live set from the infamous Berghain in 2014.</p>

<p>Regardless if I&rsquo;m writing, walking(?,) or chasing gravel apexes, these mixes always kick me into another plane, where the panning high hat halos are biased astray by a fraction of a degree, delaying a false local disorientation akin to the sound of a dozen choreographed kindergarten tap dancers' feet next to one&rsquo;s head, mildly duration-compressed. Techno as a whole has become quite comfortable with the practice of orbiting high frequency percussion in elongated ellipses around the stereo picture, which I&rsquo;ve adored and defended since day 1. My hypotheses: it&rsquo;s actually a cheap shot for the psyche&rsquo;s potential desire for justification of their club experience as something transcendent. It&rsquo;s a pretty easy cheat to keep the listener&rsquo;s immediate environment feeling expansive, reflective, and therefore <em>meaningful</em>. I, myself am probably drawn to its threatening aura of <em>imminent contiguous industrial emergency</em>, but again, I&rsquo;ve never been to Berghain, London, or Stockholm, nor has my adult nightime recreation ever found me in any venue to which one could attribute the term &ldquo;club&rdquo; without immediately ``chuckling. This music has not traditionally found its place among lives like mine, and nobody even seems interested in figuring out why.</p>

It seems like there was a big thirst for these kinds of intentions. But the more attention we get, the harder it gets to keep those intentions up and not get washed away by the perception of others. Who are maybe searching for something that sometimes seems impossible to deliver.

<p>For the hell of it, let&rsquo;s begin by removing one of techno&rsquo;s most notoriously-defining categorical descriptors: &ldquo;dance music.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve done this personally - aside from moderate head-bobbing - but I&rsquo;ve already got a bad habit of miscontextuallizing music, so let&rsquo;s focus on our hypothetical technovirgin, Gavin, who thought Bassnecter was amazing in 8th grade, can &ldquo;sometimes fuck with&rdquo; run-of-the-mill dubstep, plays college football, and is generally more serious about schoolwork than the trashy campus bars he visits every other weekend out of a vague desire for female attention. Let&rsquo;s have faith in Gavin and assume that he doesn&rsquo;t need perspective-altering narcotics to be introspective, but we&rsquo;ll wait until he&rsquo;s alone in his shitty dorm in the early morning hours, typing out an American History essay on his MacBook. He&rsquo;s in his bed, earbud-equipped noggin propped uncomfortably against the wall, machine resting on his diaphragm. It&rsquo;s streaming fucking Aphex Twin from some stranger&rsquo;s Spotify playlist, which we&rsquo;ve hacked. Just after &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/i/281953327">Windowlicker</a>&quot;&rsquo;s last, foul moan, we&rsquo;ll covertly begin this involuntary acquaintance with &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1436866071">Manium</a>&quot;&rsquo;s simple fade-in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sincerely serious, contemplative, science fiction-esque, but certainly not even as <em>manic</em> as the tasteless breast-obsessed number one hit he&rsquo;s just heard. In fact, the contrast is so sharp that his attention is agitated away from his sentence, and he looks off the screen across the room to the door&rsquo;s electronic knob. According to whomever wrote <a href="https://www.delsinrecords.com/release/6086/vril/anima-mundi">Delsin&rsquo;s description</a> of the album, Gavin has just unwittingly set upon &ldquo;a deep excursion for mind and body&rdquo; - a phrase which would no doubt make him a bit uncomfortable, yet here, alone, or perhaps in the back seat of the right friend&rsquo;s car on a long drive, its acute caution compels his mind to consider the heaviest possible question of the moment: something about <em>finals</em>, I would guess. His brow slowly scrunches in the Word document&rsquo;s soft white glow. The unchanging dissonance from the background synth&rsquo;s single chord grows louder and louder, gradually, before dropping briskly, allowing for the similar successive fade-in of &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1436866072">Statera Rerum</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Layer number one is surely a four-second sample of a dot matrix printer&rsquo;s operation, slowed and pitched-down thirty or so percent - reminiscent of the phenomena to which shopping cart castors are commonly subject: a certain speed&rsquo;s vibration triggers a sort of resonant buzzing  freakout. Vril&rsquo;s simplistic construction continues with another mechanical layer, then panned pulsar synths which ebb and recede in lazier loops across the spectrum. By now, Gavin is on his way back to reality and has finally begun alt-tabbing by the last few seconds of track 2. Just as he finds and restores his Spotify window, it has ended, and the album&rsquo;s <a href="https://song.link/i/1436866073">title track</a> begins. His investigation is stymied for a beat by the identical track and album metadata, but he&rsquo;s still curious enough to search the album out after figuring it out. Since this is a hypothetical world, let&rsquo;s make it just a bit better and assume <em>Anima Mundi</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://vrildelsin.bandcamp.com/album/anima-mundi">Bandcamp page</a> is the first result returned by Gavin&rsquo;s search engine with its brief, but gorgeous motion graphic <a href="https://fb.watch/vudt2Piez6/?">promo video</a>, which he allows to play parallel with track 3 on Spotify since it&rsquo;s less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The resulting cacophony is unlike anything he has ever heard, and - probably in reaction to his essay topic&rsquo;s inability to stimulate him whatsoever - its somewhat extended battle cry elicits sufficient intrigue to keep his attention from straying further. It&rsquo;s a lucky thing, too, because the rework of &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1436866074">Riese</a>&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/riese">giant</a>&quot;) is up next, and it&rsquo;s the most profound and unexpected groove on the whole record. It&rsquo;s rhythmless, reflective, and <em>very</em> cinematic in a similar (but far <em>far</em> superior) doctrine to Hans Zimmer&rsquo;s use of simplistic, swelling harmonious chords to blast audiences' emotional intelligence to smithereens behind films like Michael Bay&rsquo;s <em>Pearl Harbor</em> and J.J. Abrams' <em>Star Trek</em>. According to <em>Inverted Audio</em>&rsquo;s review, its notes &ldquo;<a href="https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/">lose their dissociative feeling for something a bit more intimate and in turn gain even more emotional power over the listener</a>.&rdquo; Essentially, it&rsquo;s real gorgeous, though Gavin&rsquo;s not quite in a vulnerable enough state to be moved to tears. So far, <em>Anima Mundi</em> has been almost entirely separate from &ldquo;techno&rdquo; as it is commonly defined, but it&rsquo;s clear to even the most casual fan of the scene that <strong>it&rsquo;s definitely an addendum, not abandonment</strong>. I could be wrong, but as a fan of Vril&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve found the four tracks Gavin&rsquo;s heard up to this point feel almost like the endnotes to the more brisk, purposeful melodic and rhythmic identities formed in <em><a href="https://song.link/album/i/957894188">Portal</a></em>, his first album, along his years of live club arrangements. If I were to be a bit bold, I&rsquo;d surmise that Vril could consider <em>Anima Muni</em> an artistic declaration: <em>just so you know, I am a lot more than just the guy behind the booth - I am a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi">world soul</a>.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it would be dishonest of me to extract a happy ending from my derriere for this hypothetical of ours because of a single word in track 5&rsquo;s title with truly awesome power among the Youth of Today: <em><strong>anime</strong></em>. In Spring 2017, I recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ijDWUrHaHVE"><em>Futureland</em>&rsquo;s most entertaining episode with my good friend Tevin</a>, who happens to be a beautiful bridge between fraternity culture and Japanese Animated Video Content, yet lacks faith in the former&rsquo;s chances of progressing much at all, going forward. Gavin has probably been exposed to anime once or twice, but for him, it&rsquo;s unlikely to ever become anything but a punchline. &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1436866075">Infinitum Eternis Anime</a>&rdquo; means (roughly) &ldquo;infinite eternal soul,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the record&rsquo;s first amalgam of recognizably <em>techno</em> elements (for which I do not know any of the industry/jargon terms, so do forgive my lack of detail.) It&rsquo;s a shame Gavin won&rsquo;t give it a chance because it&rsquo;d likely serve as an effective gateway drug for a more sophisticated nightlife, but I&rsquo;m sure you were getting awfully tired of him, anyway. To cite <em>Inverted Audio</em>&rsquo;s Will Long once more:</p>
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Review: Vril: Anima Mundi - Inverted Audio" data-author="Will Long" cite="https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/">
Each one of the tracks from the ‘<em>Haus’</em> EP works even better in the context of the full record. “<em>Haus</em>” gets an even smoother, more melodic rework; “<em>Riese</em>” is also more melodic in construction with the beat stripped away in favour of more reverb and sustained notes. They lose their dissociative feeling for something a bit more intimate and in turn gain even more emotional power over the listener.

<p>Though his comparison of <em>Anima Mundi</em> to Kubrick&rsquo;s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> was quite crude, I can obviously concur with some of his other language, like &ldquo;future classic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;buy on sight.&rdquo; As much as I&rsquo;d like to further indulge my own analysis of the rest of the 80 minute work&rsquo;s tracks, one-by-one, let me just conclude by doting on my personal favorite track, &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1436866081">Sine Fine</a>.&rdquo; Without resorting to the word &ldquo;ambiance,&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t say much, but - above all - it&rsquo;s Track 10 that takes me to <em>The Vril Place</em> in which I have always felt so intrigued and comfortable. Buy <em>Anima Mundi</em> right fucking now.</p>

<p name="56fb" id="56fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This week, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">we’re inaugurating our new top-shelf Music section</strong> with a comprehensive tour throughout the history of the streaming platforms who’ve both nurtured and ripped off the voices from an entirely new generation of artists followed by an album review which will be sure to blindside you in your kidneys with a fundamental truth I know you’ll love, (but could never guess.) Don’t think we’re crying wolf (or is it “passing go?”) this go-around: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/music</strong> is going to become the singular subject of our attention for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p name="d2da" id="d2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re going to take Extratone full circle and make an Electronic Music magazine for the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">new underground</em> (who are more <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">logged on</em> than they are subterranean.) The online community of friends who’s talents have continued to compel me to figure this thing out have only become more and more extraordinary in their crafts, pushing the whole network further and further upward toward its inevitable penetration of the churning, relentless surface discourse in what has become an awkwardly treacherous Indie Ocean.

He was 29.</p>
<p name="00fd" id="00fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stuart Stud, the Editor-in-Chief of The Sun, announced the death to the staff Thursday morning. Mr. Hole, who had moved to Superior after being scouted by the paper upon receiving his bachelor’s degree in fly fishing from New York University, succumbed to a catastrophic failure of his liver after allegedly “consuming a far greater-than-recreational quantity” of alcohol during an informal interview with an auxiliary source, according to someone familiar with the matter within the Sweetwater County Coroner’s Office.</p>
<p name="8723" id="8723" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In title, Mr. Hole climbed quickly from Sports Editor to Executive Daily Editor, but colleagues cited several integral, unpaid roles beyond his official functions in the newsroom.</p>
<p name="bdf2" id="bdf2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“He was a real winner,” said Hilary Hutch, who Hole had groomed personally to replace him as Sports Editor, “by far the sexist human being to grace this pokey office.

I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can’t imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not propaganda. From the experts, you’ll get <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">precisely</em> the same review, varying only in length. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The New York Times</em>’ Glenn Kenny <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">couldn’t be bothered</a> with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com’s Simon Abrams <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018" data-href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shelled out a whole 1000</a>. They are suspiciously close to these big round numbers — perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don’t care.</p>
<p name="d9e6" id="d9e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen — two emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair) who’s existing envies &amp; irritations regarding their own classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I’m not sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a fair buy — even in high school, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">drugs</em>, a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">black boyfriend</em>, and a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">stinkbomb</em>? in the old Trans Am!? <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I’m going to kill you!</em></p>
<p name="fb8f" id="fb8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Dr. Oz</em>, for Christ’s sake! Granted, talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated — especially while riding a BMX — and I don’t think Froot Loops are generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">my</em> youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I fear — if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authentic mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our parents.) It’s been two years since I knew anything about music, but I seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit" data-href="https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Father-esque post-Memphis horrorcore</a> in class — there’s something about SoundCloud that really clashes with chokers.</p>

It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mom and Dad</em>. If you want to judge Academically the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">effectiveness </em>of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Skyfall</em>,) you <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">must</em> give the little golden man to these folks, whoever they are.</p>

I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">and </em>thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">named</em> unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage <a href="https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc" data-href="https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first <a href="http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/" data-href="http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">memorize the entire screenplay</a> and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”</p>
<p name="150c" id="150c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mom and Dad</em> could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I Am Legend </em>if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself <a href="http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/" data-href="http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">described </a>it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">National Treasure</em>, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mom and Dad. </em>Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.</p>
<p name="972d" id="972d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fun </em>thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Winchester </em>(just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mom and Dad </em>does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”</p>

	* Chapter 2: &quot;Music Taste Through Generations&quot;

	  &quot;Boomers' Destructive Generational Tastemaking Disaster&quot;


		* Quote From &lt;a href=&quot;https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music&quot;&gt;the Bandcamp Essay&lt;/a&gt; 
			* It's bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development.&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock &amp; roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.
			* Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo.

			* Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;regularity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re trying to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt;.
		* This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers. It is an anomaly that has genuinely and profoundly perturbed me for virtually the entirety of my existence as a culturally literate entity - certainly longer than any of the other disturbances addressed in this volume.

			 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="qst" dir="ltr">E</p>— Skrillex (@Skrillex) <a href="https://twitter.com/Skrillex/status/14034644797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2010</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>It came to my attention today that my good friend Sonny Moore (commonly known as Skrillex) Tweeted &ldquo;E&rdquo; from his BlackBerry at 0732 CST on May 15th, 2010. If I&rsquo;m ever given the opportunity to interview him, I&rsquo;ll begin by questioning his choice in smartphones. (Can you imagine how awful the Twitter for BlackBerry client must&rsquo;ve looked in 2010?)</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve sampled of his art, I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;s an emotionally intelligent man, and probably not house producer Joel Zimmerman (commonly known as Deadmau5.) The most arresting evidence supporting this supposition is hair. Sonny Moore is not house producer Joel Zimmerman. I could be wrong, of course, but that&rsquo;d only mean that both Sonny Moore and house producer Joel Zimmerman possess a slightly above-average ability to slow time and examine us as we obliviously go about our lives in slow motion. It could even be possible that house producer Joel Zimmerman is examining my big ole' ears at this very moment in mild distaste. I guess I&rsquo;d be able to hear him if he scoffed, but I think it would be down-pitched and extraordinarily terrifying.</p>
<p>Considering, allow me to tangent shortly and ask house producer Joel Zimmerman to keep any newfound otorhinolaryngological judgments to himself, if at all possible. If you must speak, Mr. Joel Zimmerman, please try your best not to frighten me.</p>
<p>Lots of individuals in my circles frequently chide Skrillex about his alleged misunderstanding of corporeality. While it is true that he&rsquo;s been known to occasionally forgo performing at events in favor of desperately demanding answers from his audience to questions like &ldquo;how big am I?&rdquo; &ldquo;how are we able to breathe in here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;who is the whispering lady who turns off the sun?!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think he is befit of such a reputation. In fact, I think Skrillex&rsquo;s ability to make his irresistible clanking is one we should all aspire to hone. While we are kept on edge sometimes by the day-to-day stresses of contemporary life, Skrillex is able to clank them away and see the world from the broadest, slowest perspective - as a demigod.</p>
