Hilary Mantel once supposed that Howard’s work was dismissed both because of her private life (she married Kingsley Amis, and counted Arthur Koestler and Cecil Day-Lewis among her many suitors) and because of the centrality of the domestic in her work. Howard’s was the sort of fiction that’s thought, Mantel wrote, to be by women and for women; novels that “seldom try to startle or provoke the reader; on the contrary, though the narrative may unfold ingeniously, every art is employed to make the reader at ease within it.” Of course, the home—even and especially one as luscious as the Cazalet countryside estate—is the site of a thousand turns and deceptions and revelations, heightened by the comfort that both the reader and the characters feel. My best pitch for “The Cazalet Chronicles”: they’re a cross between Laurie Colwin and Elena Ferrante, with more than a bit of the Evan S.

Godot Engine: Open-Source, Feature-Rich, and Community-Driven</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open-Source and Licensing:</strong> The Godot Engine is clearly presented as an open-source project, primarily under the <strong>MIT license</strong>. This is evident in the GitHub repositories for both the documentation and the FPS starter kit, as well as explicitly stated in the Godot documentation itself (&ldquo;View license&rdquo;). The MIT license allows for significant freedom in using, modifying, and distributing the software, including for commercial purposes. The assets included in the KenneyNL FPS starter kit are explicitly mentioned as <strong>CC0 licensed</strong>, meaning they are in the public domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> The extensive list of topics covered in the Godot documentation (2D/3D graphics, physics, scripting, audio, networking, etc.) highlights the engine&rsquo;s breadth of features and the detailed resources available to developers. The documentation repository is a significant part of the Godot ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Platform Support:</strong> Godot is designed to be multi-platform, supporting various operating systems for both the editor and exported projects (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, web, etc.). The documentation details export options for different platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Scripting and Extendability:</strong> Godot supports multiple programming languages, including its own GDScript and C#. The concept of <strong>GD Extensions</strong> is mentioned as a way to extend the engine&rsquo;s functionality, particularly with languages like Swift and C++.</li>\n<li><strong>Development Practices:</strong> The documentation touches on best practices for project organization, using different node types, handling data, and optimizing performance. It also mentions the warning system in GDScript and how to use tool mode (@tool) for running code in the editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning and Release Policy:</strong> The documentation outlines Godot&rsquo;s versioning and release policy, including guidance on which version to use for new projects and upgrading existing ones. The provided sources reference Godot 4.3 and the upcoming 4.4, which is expected to include Metal support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Xogot: Bringing Godot to the iPad with Swift UI</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Challenge of Porting to iPad:</strong> Miguel de Icaza&rsquo;s talk and the Discord conversations highlight the significant challenges of bringing a desktop-focused game engine like Godot to the iPad. Key issues include:</li>\n<li><strong>Input Differences:</strong> Godot is designed for mouse and keyboard, while the iPad relies on touch and optional accessories like the Apple Pencil and external keyboards. This requires a significant redesign of the UI and interaction methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Touch Target Size:</strong> Apple&rsquo;s requirement for a minimum tapable region (44 points, roughly 150 pixels) necessitates larger UI elements than typically found in the desktop Godot editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Expected Gestures:</strong> iPad users expect certain gestures to be available, which need to be implemented.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> While iPads have powerful chips (M series), optimizing performance on a mobile device is crucial.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple&rsquo;s Security and App Store Policies:</strong> These policies, particularly regarding code signing and the loading of dynamic libraries, pose limitations on supporting features like third-party C++ GD Extensions.</li>\n<li><strong>Swift UI as the Solution:</strong> The Xogot project leverages <strong>Swift UI</strong> to build a native iPad user interface. The key advantage of Swift UI, according to Miguel de Icaza, is its declarative approach and focus on a &ldquo;source of truth,&rdquo; which simplifies UI updates based on data model changes.</li>\n<li><strong>LibGodot:</strong> A fundamental component of Xogot is the use of <strong>libgodot.a</strong>, a modular build of the Godot core engine. This allows Xogot to embed Godot views and content within the Swift UI application, enabling the mixing of native and engine elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtualization of Godot State:</strong> A significant technical achievement discussed is the virtualization of Godot&rsquo;s global state. This allows the Xogot application to run both the editor and a game instance simultaneously by &ldquo;ping-ponging&rdquo; a variable that points to the respective state.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;essentially every time that there&rsquo;s an access to a global variable&hellip; it would allocate it and instead what I did is I would have a big ass variable that contained the state of the whole app&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;and the trick is all you got to do is change that jro variable so J points there it&rsquo;s the editor then you change it and it points there and now it&rsquo;s the game&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Reorganizing the UI for iPad:</strong> To address the limitations and expectations of the iPad, the Xogot UI is being significantly redesigned. This includes:</li>\n<li>Rewriting high-traffic dialogues in Swift UI.</li>\n<li>Simplifying or removing features from the editor UI to save space, with the understanding that users can return to the desktop version for full configuration.</li>\n<li>Adjusting the visual presentation of elements like font data.</li>\n<li><strong>Limitations of Xogot:</strong> Due to Apple&rsquo;s policies and the project&rsquo;s current stage:</li>\n<li>Only <strong>GDScript</strong> is supported as the scripting language.</li>\n<li><strong>Third-party C++ GD Extensions are not supported</strong>, as dynamically loading code is restricted. Popular extensions may be bundled in the future.</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>C# GD Extensions</strong> is also limited due to the need for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which is generally restricted on iOS.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Development and Beta Testing:</strong> The Discord conversations demonstrate active development, bug fixing, and beta testing with a community of users. Users are reporting bugs related to various aspects of the editor and engine, such as:</li>\n<li>Invalid states in animations.</li>\n<li>Issues with TileSets and TileMaps.</li>\n<li>Crashes related to script editor tabs.</li>\n<li>Visual bugs in the UI.</li>\n<li>Problems with specific nodes and their properties (e.g., Label tab stop values, ColorRect).</li>\n<li>Performance concerns, particularly on lower-end iPads.</li>\n<li>Trouble with procedural sound generation.</li>\n<li><strong>Features Being Implemented and Explored:</strong> The team is actively working on and discussing various features:</li>\n<li>Implementing native editors for different Godot components (TileSet, TileMapLayer, Animation, Debugger, Output).</li>\n<li>Improving visual editors (e.g., for shaders, curves, gradients).</li>\n<li>Adding paint functionality to the TileSet editor.</li>\n<li>Supporting running games embedded within the editor.</li>\n<li>Implementing features for managing projects and assets (e.g., rescanning the file system, supporting addons).</li>\n<li>Adding support for external displays.</li>\n<li>Exploring support for running local LLMs.</li>\n<li>Considering support for Vision Pro and iPhone (though iPhone support is seen as more challenging due to the need for a full experience).</li>\n<li>Discussing the implementation of Feature Tags for conditional code based on platform or configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetization and Future Vision:</strong> There are discussions about the future of Xogot, including its potential cost and target audience. While there is testing of a paywall in the beta (with no actual charges), the final monetization model is not yet decided. Miguel de Icaza&rsquo;s vision seems to be more than just a simple port, aiming for an Apple Design Award and providing a robust game development experience on the iPad. There is also excitement about the potential for <strong>embedding Godot scenes within native iOS/Android/Mac apps using libgodot</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Godot Project Examples and Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FPS Starter Kit:</strong> The KenneyNL FPS Starter Kit provides a concrete example of a Godot project, showcasing basic FPS features like a character controller, weapons, enemies, and the use of sprites and 3D models. This highlights the types of projects that can be created with Godot.</li>\n<li><strong>Godot Documentation as a Resource:</strong> The detailed documentation on Godot&rsquo;s features and development practices serves as a vital resource for developers using the engine, including those working with Xogot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Most Important Ideas/Facts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Xogot is a significant project to bring the full Godot Engine experience to the iPad.</strong> This is being achieved through a native Swift UI interface layered on top of the Godot core (libgodot.a).</li>\n<li><strong>The project addresses the unique challenges of mobile development, particularly input methods and UI design for touch interfaces.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Virtualizing Godot&rsquo;s internal state is a key technical innovation enabling the concurrent running of the editor and game.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Current limitations include limited support for third-party GD Extensions (C++ and C#) and only GDScript as the primary scripting language.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Xogot is in active beta testing, with ongoing bug fixing and the implementation of core editor features.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The future of Xogot includes potential monetization, expansion to other Apple platforms (iPhone, Vision Pro, Apple TV), and the possibility of embedding Godot content in native apps.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Godot&rsquo;s open-source nature under the MIT license is fundamental to projects like Xogot.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This briefing provides a snapshot of the information presented in the sources, highlighting the core concepts and current status of Godot engine development and the ambitious Xogot project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h3>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-xogot\">What is Xogot?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Xogot is an implementation of the Godot game engine specifically designed to run on Apple&rsquo;s iPad, with ongoing work to support iPhone as well. It aims to bring the full Godot editor and development experience to mobile devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-does-xogot-differ-from-the-standard-godot-editor\">How does Xogot differ from the standard Godot editor?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>While Xogot uses the core Godot editor functionalities (through libgodot.a and creative use of GD extensions), it features a completely rewritten user interface using Swift UI. This new UI is optimized for touch input and the constraints of a mobile device, with larger tap targets and a focus on a more streamlined experience. It intentionally removes some configuration options deemed less essential for a mobile workflow, assuming users can utilize the desktop version for more advanced settings if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what-programming-languages-are-supported-in-xogot\">What programming languages are supported in Xogot?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, only GDScript is officially supported in Xogot. Due to Apple&rsquo;s security restrictions, dynamic libraries (like those used by C++ GD extensions) are not allowed to be added after the application is approved for the App Store. There are plans to potentially bundle popular C++ extensions directly into the Xogot binary in the future. C# is also not currently supported, likely due to limitations with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation on iOS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"can-i-use-my-existing-godot-projects-with-xogot\">Can I use my existing Godot projects with Xogot?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, you can use your existing Godot projects with Xogot. You can transfer your project folder to the iPad and open it in the Xogot application. Projects created in the desktop version of Godot can be opened and edited in Xogot, and vice-versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"are-there-any-limitations-to-using-xogot-compared-to-the-desktop-version\">Are there any limitations to using Xogot compared to the desktop version?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, there are some limitations. As mentioned, only GDScript is currently supported, and third-party C++ GD extensions cannot be dynamically loaded. The UI is also streamlined, meaning some advanced configuration options might be missing or presented differently. There have also been reports of some specific functionalities, like certain animation properties, TileSet/TileMap editing nuances, and debugger output, still being refined and having some bugs or limitations compared to the desktop version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-the-licensing-model-for-xogot\">What is the licensing model for Xogot?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Xogot application is currently in a beta testing phase via TestFlight. While there have been discussions and testing of in-app purchases and a &ldquo;paywall&rdquo; during the beta, any purchases made during this phase do not actually charge the user. The final pricing and monetization strategy for Xogot have not been officially announced, but the developers are aware of community concerns about pricing and sustainability. The core Godot engine and the assets included in the KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-FPS, which Xogot builds upon, are released under permissive licenses (MIT and CC0 respectively).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-can-i-get-access-to-the-xogot-beta\">How can I get access to the Xogot beta?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Xogot beta is available through Apple&rsquo;s TestFlight program. You need to sign up using a form, typically providing your TestFlight ID or Apple ID. Invites are sent out in batches, so there might be a waiting period after signing up. Information regarding the sign-up process is usually shared within the Xogot community channels (like Discord).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what-are-the-main-goals-of-the-xogot-project\">What are the main goals of the Xogot project?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary goal of Xogot is to provide a powerful and user-friendly Godot editor experience on the iPad (and eventually iPhone). This involves adapting the existing Godot core to the mobile environment, creating a touch-optimized UI, and ensuring compatibility with desktop Godot projects. The project also aims to utilize and contribute back to the Godot engine itself, such as integrating Metal rendering backend support. There&rsquo;s also a desire to cater to both existing Godot developers who want to work on the go and potentially new developers looking for a mobile-friendly game development tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"integration-note\">Integration Note</h3>\n<p>Hello! I am here to act as your paid consultant and thought partner, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you&rsquo;ve provided to help you quickly analyze information and develop strategic recommendations. I have access to excerpts from the Xogot App Store release notes, documentation on differences between Xogot and Godot, Godot export documentation for iOS, Xogot FAQ, Xogot Getting Started guides, Reddit discussions about Godot on mobile and iOS, Godot 4.4 documentation, Xogot documentation on various topics like UI, assets, controls, TestFlight notes, a blog post about Xogot on iPadOS, Product Hunt reviews, the Xogot App Store listing, and Discord chat logs related to Xogot features, bugs, and discussions. I can help you navigate these materials, understand complex topics, and formulate well-supported insights.</p>\n<p>Xogot is designed to integrate closely with existing Godot development workflows and tools, aiming to provide a native iPad experience that complements, rather than replaces, desktop Godot usage. The core principle is to build upon the powerful, open-source Godot engine, making it accessible and effective on a touch-first device like the iPad.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how Xogot integrates with existing Godot workflows and tools:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Project Compatibility and Mobility</strong>: A fundamental aspect of Xogot&rsquo;s integration is project compatibility. Projects created in Xogot are intended to be fully compatible with the desktop edition of Godot. This allows users to move projects back and forth between the two platforms.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Importing Projects</strong>: Existing Godot projects can be brought into Xogot using the Files App integration. This involves saving project files to a location accessible by the Files App (like iCloud Drive) and then copying them into the Xogot folder on the iPad. If the project is large, re-importing assets can take some time.</li>\n<li><strong>Using Version Control</strong>: Xogot recommends using native iOS Git clients like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. Users can clone repositories directly into the Xogot projects area or add existing project folders in Xogot as linked repositories in Working Copy. Pushing changes and using linked folders with Working Copy requires a Pro unlock. While Xogot itself does not have native Git support, this workflow allows users to manage their Godot projects with Git on the iPad.</li>\n<li><strong>Exporting Projects</strong>: Xogot currently supports exporting projects to WebAssembly, which can be shared via a link for playtesting in a web browser. Other export options, such as exporting for iOS (which requires a macOS machine and Xcode), Android, Windows, or other platforms, must be done using Godot on the desktop. The process for exporting a Godot project to Xcode for iOS development involves using the Godot editor&rsquo;s export window on macOS, setting up required Apple Developer account information, and then building and deploying from Xcode. For active development, Godot project files can be linked directly into an Xcode project to avoid re-exporting after every change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>User Interface and Experience</strong>: Xogot&rsquo;s UI is a significant area of adaptation from standard Godot. It is specifically designed to be touch-friendly and align with iPadOS conventions.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPadOS Adaptation</strong>: This includes making UI elements more tappable, simplifying parts of the interface to conserve screen real estate, and replacing some toolbar icons with Apple&rsquo;s SF Symbols. Tooltips, which rely on hovering, are not surfaced due to the iPad&rsquo;s touch interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid UI Approach</strong>: Instead of fully rewriting the entire Godot editor UI in SwiftUI, Xogot uses a hybrid approach. It has a native SwiftUI shell that embeds Godot views as a library (libgodot). High-traffic or critical dialogues are being rewritten natively in SwiftUI for a better touch experience, such as the TileSet and TileMapLayer editors, the Audio bus editor, and the Shader Editor. Less frequently used or plugin-specific UI elements might still embed the original Godot views.</li>\n<li><strong>Differences from Godot UI</strong>: While aiming for a native feel, this results in some differences from the desktop Godot UI. For example, Project Settings navigation is adapted. Some users miss the classic Godot node icons, though Xogot offers an option to use them instead of SF Symbols. There are ongoing discussions and work based on user feedback to tune the UI and bring back or adapt features for a better workflow on iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Supported Scripting and Extensions</strong>: A key difference and limitation in Xogot compared to desktop Godot is the supported scripting languages and extensions.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GDScript Only</strong>: Xogot exclusively supports Godot&rsquo;s built-in scripting language, GDScript.</li>\n<li><strong>No Compiled Languages</strong>: Support for other compiled languages like C#, C++, Swift, or Rust is not included in Xogot. This means projects or addons written in these languages are unlikely to work directly in Xogot. While Godot 4.2+ experimentally supports exporting C# projects to iOS, this is a function of the desktop editor, not Xogot itself. Adding support for C# or arbitrary compiled GDExtensions in Xogot is not currently planned due to technical hurdles related to Apple&rsquo;s policies on arbitrary code execution and toolchain inclusion.</li>\n<li><strong>GDScript Addons</strong>: Addons and plugins written solely in GDScript are supported and can be enabled via project settings. Users place the addon code in the &lsquo;addons&rsquo; directory within the project folder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Editor Functionality</strong>: Xogot provides access to most core Godot editor functionalities, adapted for the iPad experience.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Editors</strong>: Includes dedicated editors for 2D and 3D scenes, a script editor, animation editor, and tilemap/tileset editors. Recent improvements have focused on native SwiftUI rewrites for key editors like TileSet and TileMapLayer.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspector and Settings</strong>: The Inspector and Project Settings panels are available, with some UI adaptations for iPad. All Project Settings from Godot are intended to be available, though the UI for navigating them is different.</li>\n<li><strong>Debugger</strong>: A fully integrated debugger is included, supporting breakpoints, exploring program state, and profiling. Runtime errors are surfaced with descriptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Importing</strong>: Supports common asset types (sprites, textures, sounds, 3D models) and provides multiple ways to import them directly on the iPad via Files App or drag and drop. Specific formats like .gltf and .obj for 3D models are supported with notes on required accompanying files.</li>\n<li><strong>Input Handling</strong>: Provides support for various input devices, including external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers. A notable feature is the built-in iOS virtual controller, which maps to Xbox button conventions and can be configured via the Input Map in Project Settings. This allows quick testing of desktop projects on iPad without requiring custom touch controls. Users can also manually add touch controls like the Virtual Joystick Addon. There have been reports and fixes related to multi-touch event handling in the editor and running games. Support for accelerometer/gyroscope is available but might require exporting the game to test fully.</li>\n<li><strong>Rendering</strong>: Xogot is based on Godot 4.4+. It supports Godot&rsquo;s rendering engines (Metal, Vulkan) and rendering methods (Mobile, Forward+, OpenGL), configurable in Project Settings. Metal backend support is integrated.</li>\n<li><strong>External Displays and Multitasking</strong>: Supports iPadOS multitasking features like Split View and Stage Manager, allowing work across multiple displays.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Xogot includes integrated learning resources to help users get started.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Provides integrated API documentation and tutorials. This includes Xogot-specific guides (like Getting Started, UI, Importing Assets, Onscreen Controls, Working with Git) and documentation on differences from Godot. Links to the official Godot documentation are also beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Sample Projects</strong>: Comes preloaded with sample projects in the &ldquo;Learning Center&rdquo; to help users explore features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, Xogot functions as a Godot editor specifically tailored for iPadOS. It maintains project compatibility with desktop Godot, allowing developers to seamlessly transition their work. While it adapts the UI for touch and leverages native iOS features, it currently focuses on GDScript and doesn&rsquo;t support compiled languages or arbitrary GDExtensions, requiring desktop Godot for projects dependent on these. Core editor functionalities are present and being actively refined for the touch environment, alongside built-in learning resources.</p>\n<p>As a next step, considering the focus on compatibility and the unique iPad workflow, you might want to investigate the specific performance characteristics of Xogot compared to desktop Godot for different types of projects (e.g., 2D vs 3D, asset heavy vs code heavy) to understand the practical limitations and ideal use cases for developing solely or partially on iPad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-considerations-and-limitations-note\">Technical Considerations and Limitations Note</h3>\n<p>As your paid consultant and thought partner, I will now detail the unique technical considerations and limitations when using Xogot, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you&rsquo;ve provided. I have access to a range of materials including release notes, documentation on differences and features, Godot export guides, Reddit discussions, and Discord chat logs, which allow me to analyze Xogot from technical, operational, and user perspective.</p>\n<p>Xogot is built upon the robust Godot engine but is specifically engineered for the iPadOS environment, which introduces several technical considerations and limitations that differ from the standard desktop Godot experience. These considerations are primarily driven by the architecture of iPadOS, Apple&rsquo;s platform policies, and the design choices made to optimize for a touch-first interface.</p>\n<p>Here is a detailed breakdown of the unique technical considerations and limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Core Architecture and Process Management:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Xogot employs a hybrid architecture, using a native SwiftUI shell to embed Godot engine views via <code>libgodot</code>. This approach allows for a more native iPadOS feel while leveraging the core Godot functionality.</li>\n<li>A major technical hurdle overcome was the iPadOS restriction on running multiple processes simultaneously. Unlike the desktop Godot editor, which launches a separate process for running a game, iPadOS does not allow a child process to run alongside the parent application.</li>\n<li>To address this, the Xogot team had to &ldquo;virtualize&rdquo; Godot, modifying its core to allow multiple instances to run within a single application process. Early attempts involved manually resetting the entire Godot state when switching between the editor and running the game. A more robust solution was achieved by making Godot&rsquo;s root singleton thread-local storage and managing separate graphics contexts. This complex adaptation ensures the editor and the running game can coexist within the same application, enabling features like the integrated debugger.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scripting Language Support (Limited to GDScript):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A significant limitation is that Xogot exclusively supports Godot&rsquo;s built-in scripting language, GDScript.</li>\n<li>Compiled languages such as C#, C++, Swift, or Rust are <em>not</em> supported. The technical challenge here is substantial; supporting languages like Swift would require embedding the entire Swift compiler and toolchain within the app, which is not currently planned. Godot&rsquo;s recent transition from Mono to CoreCLR further complicates C# support specifically for the iOS platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GDExtension and Plugin Support (GDScript Only):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Related to scripting, Xogot only supports addons and plugins written purely in GDScript.</li>\n<li>Compiled GDExtensions written in languages like C++ or C# are <em>not</em> supported. This limitation stems from Apple&rsquo;s App Store policies, which generally prohibit applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries for security reasons.</li>\n<li>For popular GDExtensions to work in Xogot, they would need to be specifically ported to be multi-instance compatible and then potentially bundled directly within the Xogot application binary after careful consideration and porting efforts. Users have voiced interest in support for specific extensions like Godot-Jolt and Godot-Voxel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>User Interface Adaptation and Hybrid Implementation:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>While Xogot is built on Godot, its user interface is heavily adapted for iPadOS to be touch-friendly, leading to differences compared to the desktop editor. This involves larger tappable regions, simplified layouts, and the use of SF Symbols instead of standard Godot icons in many places.</li>\n<li>Not all parts of the UI have been rewritten in SwiftUI. High-traffic areas like the TileSet, TileMapLayer, Audio bus, and Shader editors are being rebuilt natively for a better touch experience. However, less frequently used components or third-party plugins may still display the original Godot UI, resulting in a sometimes inconsistent visual style.</li>\n<li>Certain interactions common in desktop Godot may be missing or adapted. For example, tooltips are not available due to the lack of hover on touch devices. Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported with an external keyboard, but some desktop interactions like tabbing between inspector properties can be tricky to implement in the adapted UI. Users have also noted differences in behaviors like dragging objects accidentally triggering other editor windows.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Performance and Memory Constraints:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Memory usage is a key limitation on iPads, particularly for larger projects or on devices with less RAM. Users have reported low memory warnings and crashes, especially with projects that run many print statements or are generally asset-heavy.</li>\n<li>There have been ongoing efforts to reduce memory consumption and fix leaks. Memory spiking when the app is sent to the background was identified as a cause of crashes.</li>\n<li>While modern M-series chips on iPads offer significant processing power, available RAM appears to be a more critical factor for smooth performance in Xogot.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Input Handling Specificities:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Xogot supports external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers, providing a familiar experience for desktop users.</li>\n<li>A unique iOS-only feature is the built-in virtual controller, configurable in Project Settings. This maps to Xbox conventions and allows for testing games designed for controllers without implementing custom touch controls. However, it offers less customization than using a GDScript-based virtual joystick addon.</li>\n<li>Handling multi-touch input in both the editor and running games has presented challenges, with bugs reported regarding simultaneous touch events and the distinction between raw touches and pan/magnification gestures. The input system has been modified and is not the same as vanilla Godot, which impacts upstreaming fixes.</li>\n<li>Apple Pencil support is present, allowing for fine detail work, but features like hover input may not be fully supported by Godot itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>File System Integration and Version Control Workflow:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Xogot leverages the iPadOS Files App for project and asset import/export. This allows transferring projects via iCloud Drive, local storage (&ldquo;On My iPad&rdquo;), or connected external drives. Drag and drop is supported for assets.</li>\n<li>While projects can be saved to external locations, direct integration with cloud storage like iCloud Drive required adopting complex asynchronous File IO APIs and was not initially fully supported for saving.</li>\n<li>Xogot does <em>not</em> have built-in Git support. The recommended workflow involves using a separate native iOS Git client like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. This requires using features like cloning into the Xogot folder or adding the project folder as a linked repository. Some advanced Git features require a Pro unlock in Working Copy. Command-line Git can also be used via an iSH terminal with mounting the Xogot directory.</li>\n<li>A potential pitfall when moving projects between desktop OSes (Windows/Mac, which are typically case-insensitive) and iPadOS (which is case-sensitive) is issues arising from inconsistent file or folder casing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Exporting and Deployment Limitations:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, Xogot supports exporting projects to WebAssembly for playtesting via a hosted link. This feature hosts the build on <code>share.xogot.com</code> for a limited time.</li>\n<li>Exporting to other platforms (such as native iOS apps, Android, Windows, etc.) must be done using the desktop version of Godot. The process for building a native iOS app from a Godot project requires a macOS machine, Xcode, export templates, and an Apple Developer account. Direct native iOS app building/deployment from Xogot is not a current feature, although it is a desired capability. The &ldquo;Export&rdquo; option in Xogot currently initiates iOS and WebAssembly exports.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Device and OS Version Requirements:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Xogot requires iPadOS 18.0 or later and an iPad with an A12 Bionic chip or newer. This is due to reliance on APIs introduced in iOS/iPadOS 17 and extensively in 18.</li>\n<li>Older iPadOS versions are not supported.</li>\n<li>While the app can be installed and partially used on iPhones running iOS 18, the UI is not optimized for smaller screens, and some features may not work correctly.</li>\n<li>It runs on VisionPro as the iPad app, not a dedicated build.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These technical considerations mean that while Xogot offers a powerful Godot development experience on the iPad, it functions best as part of a larger workflow that may still require a desktop machine for tasks like building final native apps or utilizing plugins written in compiled languages. The ongoing development is actively addressing many of these points, particularly around UI native-ness and core editor functionality adapted for touch and memory constraints.</p>\n<p>Considering these points, a potential next step for analysis could be to delve into how these specific technical limitations translate into workflow friction for different user segments (e.g., hobbyists, professional indies, developers building plugins or using advanced features) and identify which limitations are most critical for improving the value proposition of Xogot as a standalone development environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-control-and-collaboration-note\">Version Control and Collaboration Note</h3>\n<p>As your paid consultant and thought partner, let&rsquo;s delve into how Xogot approaches version control and collaboration for Godot projects, drawing upon the information available in the sources you&rsquo;ve provided. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for assessing workflow efficiency and scalability, which can inform strategic recommendations.</p>\n<p>Xogot enables version control and collaboration for Godot projects primarily by leveraging the native file management capabilities of iPadOS and recommending the use of external, dedicated applications for Git integration. It does not feature a built-in Git client within the application itself, a decision influenced by the technical constraints and platform policies of iPadOS.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how this is facilitated and the considerations involved:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Leveraging iPadOS Files App Integration:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The foundation of Xogot&rsquo;s approach lies in its deep integration with the iPadOS Files App. This allows users to store their Godot projects and assets in locations accessible by other apps on the iPad, such as iCloud Drive, &ldquo;On My iPad&rdquo; storage, or connected external drives.</li>\n<li>This integration means that the actual project files (<code>.godot</code> folder, <code>.tscn</code>, <code>.gd</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.) reside within the standard iPadOS file system, making them visible and manageable by any application that can interact with files in those locations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Recommended Method: External Git Clients (Specifically Working Copy):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Because Xogot itself does not include Git functionality, the recommended workflow for version control involves using a separate, native iOS Git client. Working Copy is explicitly endorsed and recommended for this purpose.</li>\n<li>Working Copy integrates seamlessly with the Files App, allowing it to access and manage the project files stored in the Xogot folder or other locations accessible via Files.</li>\n<li>To use Working Copy with a Xogot project, users can either clone a Git repository directly into the Xogot folder using Working Copy, or add an existing Xogot project folder as a &ldquo;Linked Repository&rdquo; within Working Copy.</li>\n<li>This enables users to perform standard Git operations – such as committing changes, pushing to and fetching from remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab), branching, etc. – using the Working Copy interface. Xogot automatically reflects file changes made by Working Copy due to the Files App integration.</li>\n<li>It is noted that certain advanced features in Working Copy, like pushing changes and using linked folders, may require a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; unlock.</li>\n<li>Users have confirmed that they successfully use this workflow with services like GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative Method: Command-Line Git via iSH:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>For users who are comfortable with command-line interfaces, the documentation also suggests using iSH, a Linux shell emulator for iPadOS, to manage Git repositories.</li>\n<li>This involves installing Git within iSH, mounting the Xogot project directory to the iSH file system, and then running standard Git commands from the iSH terminal within that mounted directory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reasoning for No Built-in Git:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The decision not to include a built-in Git client or support traditional Godot Git plugins stems from the architectural limitations and security policies of iPadOS and the Apple App Store.</li>\n<li>Apple&rsquo;s policies generally restrict applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries or executing arbitrary code from outside the app&rsquo;s sandbox. This makes it technically challenging, if not impossible under standard App Store distribution, to bundle and run a generic Git client library or Godot&rsquo;s desktop-style Git plugin within the Xogot app.</li>\n<li>Additionally, the core changes made to Godot to run within a single process on iPadOS, allowing the editor and game to coexist (&ldquo;virtualizing&rdquo; Godot), likely impact how tightly integrated external tools like Git plugins could be.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Implications for Collaboration:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This file-system-based approach, combined with external Git clients, directly supports collaborative workflows. Teams can store their Godot project in a shared Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).</li>\n<li>Developers using Xogot on their iPads can pull the latest changes from the repository, work on the project locally using Xogot, and then commit and push their changes back to the shared repository using their Git client (like Working Copy).</li>\n<li>This allows multiple team members, whether they are using Xogot on iPad or desktop Godot on Windows, macOS, or Linux, to contribute to the same project. Projects created in Xogot are compatible with desktop Godot and vice versa.</li>\n<li>The &ldquo;Share Your Work&rdquo; feature, which exports projects to WebAssembly for easy playtesting via a hosted link, also facilitates a form of collaboration by enabling rapid feedback loops on playable builds, although it&rsquo;s not direct code collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No In-Editor Git UI:</strong> A significant limitation compared to desktop IDEs or the standard Godot editor with a Git plugin is the lack of a fully integrated Git user interface within Xogot itself. Users must switch to a separate app (Working Copy or iSH) to perform version control operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Case Sensitivity:</strong> A potential pitfall when collaborating on projects stored in Git and shared between desktop operating systems (like Windows or macOS, often case-insensitive file systems) and iPadOS (a case-sensitive file system) is that inconsistent casing in file or folder names can lead to issues or errors when opening or running the project on iPadOS. Users have reported encountering errors related to this when importing projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Workflow Friction:</strong> The necessity of using external apps adds steps to the development workflow compared to environments with integrated Git.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, Xogot enables version control and collaboration by relying on standard iPadOS file management and external Git applications. While it lacks built-in Git features due to platform constraints, this approach facilitates interoperability with desktop Godot workflows and allows teams to use established Git-based collaboration models.</p>\n<p>A potential next step in analysis could be to evaluate the degree of workflow friction introduced by this external Git dependency for typical Godot development tasks (e.g., committing frequently, resolving merge conflicts) and how this might impact the appeal of Xogot as a primary development environment compared to a supplementary one for on-the-go work.</p>\n",

GNOME 1.2 is released with issues, including shipping with five different clock applications. This experience informs de Icaza's later development philosophies, specifically the idea of avoiding unnecessary options and complexity.\n- **Pre-Xogot Development (Undated, implied years prior to GodotCon 2024):** Miguel de Icaza works on Swift language bindings for Godot Engine as a GD Extension. He also works with another fellow named Nat Friedman to create Mono, an open-source .NET implementation, which Unity Engine is later built around.\n- **Prior to GodotCon 2024:** Initial work is done on a \"libgodot\" approach for embedding Godot within other applications. Miguel de Icaza expresses his dream of this functionality to Juan.\n- **GodotCon 2024:** Miguel de Icaza gives a talk detailing the development of Xogot, a project to bring Godot Engine to the iPad. He explains the challenges of adapting Godot's desktop-centric UI for a touch interface and the approach of using Swift UI as a separate UI layer communicating with the Godot editor core (the source of truth). He highlights the successful virtualization of the Godot editor and game running simultaneously by manipulating a variable pointing to the application's state. He also mentions the limitations of the platform, such as only supporting GDScript and not supporting third-party C++ GD Extensions due to Apple's security policies. The goal is to achieve an Apple Design Award. The beta test program is announced, requiring a TestFlight ID or Apple ID and information on needed GD Extensions.\n- **November 13, 2024:** Users begin discussing Git issues related to dubious ownership. Joseph.hill confirms receipt of requests for beta access.\n- **November 14, 2024:** Djemergency reports a visual bug with export variables not displaying correctly (e.g., \"walkingSpeed\" appearing as \"walkingSpeed\" instead of \"Walking Speed\").\n- **November 15, 2024:** Hyouuu. requests beta access. Miguel de Icaza confirms he will process requests later.\n- **November 16, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza announces a new batch of beta testers has been invited. Several users, including russellup.art, trueh_91782, hilidice, brunotor, bpgam3z, and silent_rkgk, confirm joining the server and express excitement. Discussions about server administration and behavior occur.\n- **November 17, 2024:** Discussions about visual shaders and the potential to replace the visual editor dock occur. Detox0236 requests the status bar be hidden for fullscreen testing. Wolfybl is noted for being impatient about getting beta access. Joseph.hill sends out a tranche of invites. Miguel de Icaza notes they haven't done any rejections for the beta. Discussion about the TestFlight beta duration (90 days). Users confirm projects can be created on the desktop Godot version and transferred to the Xogot folder on iPad.\n- **November 18, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza comments on viewport issues.\n- **November 19, 2024:** Clancey asks detox0236 about having multiple games in their GitHub repo. Detox0236 confirms. Miguel de Icaza notes an issue with something triggering a stop. Ciidi inquires if an invalid method after variables in a script could cause this and mentions random green highlighting in the script editor. A link to a GitHub repository of \"godot-ipad-demos\" by celyk is shared.\n- **November 20, 2024:** Endritdev expresses appreciation for the \"Infinite Canvas\" demo. Detox0236 clarifies their request for a hidden status bar is for running the scene embedded, but Miguel de Icaza initially thought they meant on its own scene. Miguel de Icaza considers running the scene in the same window for more control over fullscreen.\n- **November 22, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza reports that a Skeleton3D issue uncovered multiple issues and he is close to fixing them. Mascaz offers to continue testing once fixes are out.\n- **November 23, 2024:** Detox0236 notes that Xogot pauses music playback. Andrekling asks about the code window adjusting in vertical mode. Users discuss the lack of support for C++ GD Extensions. Paraxikology confirms their custom extensions are not public. Firesonwires notes that C# extensions likely won't be possible either due to JIT.\n- **November 24, 2024:** Endritdev mentions the Windows development of their personal project. Miguel de Icaza confirms that C++ GD Extensions and C# extensions won't be possible for a while but has an idea for native ones.\n- **November 25, 2024:** Users comment positively on the visual appearance of Xogot. Miguel de Icaza advises kindness in discussions. Wolfybl and thedarkwaterbun confirm knowing each other from another server. Vernacular mentions their Apple devices sharing data. Clancey suggests asking Apple for an exception for Xogot regarding data sharing. Vernacular humorously dismisses the idea due to homework.\n- **November 26, 2024:** Vernacular and Clancey discuss Apple device data sharing. Miguel de Icaza reacts with a smiley face.\n- **November 27, 2024:** Verxion suggests using Xogot for homework. Joseph.hill sends out another wave of invites. Detox0236 comments on the user data sharing.\n- **November 28, 2024:** Endritdev asks if game building/exporting is possible or will be included. Miguel de Icaza confirms James is working on an \"export game\" feature in developer mode. Victororange_ observes that invites seem to be sent in batches in the mornings.\n- **November 29, 2024:** Joseph.hill sends out a fresh batch of invites. Paraxikology asks if Xogot will be locked to Godot 4.3. Josephsmth relays that Miguel de Icaza's talk indicated relatively easy updates to new Godot versions, including the upcoming 4.4 with Metal support.\n- **November 30, 2024:** Endritdev highlights the need for visual tools for curves, color ramps, and gradients, noting that standard Godot has these.\n- **December 1, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza anticipates finding many touch scenarios needing improvement and wants a catalog of these. Josephistheone asks if Xogot is a one-time use thing (likely referring to the TestFlight duration). A link to the V-Sekai/xr-grid GitHub repository is shared.\n- **December 5, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza fixes a bug related to binding objects from different \"domains\" (editor vs. game). Snowminx shares a GIF of the bug.\n- **December 12, 2024:** Discussion about a pencil drawing feature in VR or \"pancake\" mode. Detox0236 had trouble with procedurally generating sound.\n- **December 16, 2024:** Discussion about Xogot running on iPhones, noting it launches but isn't particularly useful yet.\n- **December 17, 2024:** Users react positively to a visual update shared by Miguel de Icaza.\n- **December 18, 2024:** Miguel de Icaza mentions papercuts but is excited about the visual update. A screen recording of the UI is shared.

Godot Engine: Open-Source, Feature-Rich, and Community-Driven**\n\n- **Open-Source and Licensing:** The Godot Engine is clearly presented as an open-source project, primarily under the **MIT license**. This is evident in the GitHub repositories for both the documentation and the FPS starter kit, as well as explicitly stated in the Godot documentation itself (\"View license\"). The MIT license allows for significant freedom in using, modifying, and distributing the software, including for commercial purposes. The assets included in the KenneyNL FPS starter kit are explicitly mentioned as **CC0 licensed**, meaning they are in the public domain.\n- **Comprehensive Documentation:** The extensive list of topics covered in the Godot documentation (2D/3D graphics, physics, scripting, audio, networking, etc.) highlights the engine's breadth of features and the detailed resources available to developers. The documentation repository is a significant part of the Godot ecosystem.\n- **Multi-Platform Support:** Godot is designed to be multi-platform, supporting various operating systems for both the editor and exported projects (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, web, etc.). The documentation details export options for different platforms.\n- **Scripting and Extendability:** Godot supports multiple programming languages, including its own GDScript and C#. The concept of **GD Extensions** is mentioned as a way to extend the engine's functionality, particularly with languages like Swift and C++.\n- **Development Practices:** The documentation touches on best practices for project organization, using different node types, handling data, and optimizing performance. It also mentions the warning system in GDScript and how to use tool mode (@tool) for running code in the editor.\n- **Versioning and Release Policy:** The documentation outlines Godot's versioning and release policy, including guidance on which version to use for new projects and upgrading existing ones. The provided sources reference Godot 4.3 and the upcoming 4.4, which is expected to include Metal support.\n\n**2. Xogot: Bringing Godot to the iPad with Swift UI**\n\n- **The Challenge of Porting to iPad:** Miguel de Icaza's talk and the Discord conversations highlight the significant challenges of bringing a desktop-focused game engine like Godot to the iPad. Key issues include:\n- **Input Differences:** Godot is designed for mouse and keyboard, while the iPad relies on touch and optional accessories like the Apple Pencil and external keyboards. This requires a significant redesign of the UI and interaction methods.\n- **Touch Target Size:** Apple's requirement for a minimum tapable region (44 points, roughly 150 pixels) necessitates larger UI elements than typically found in the desktop Godot editor.\n- **Expected Gestures:** iPad users expect certain gestures to be available, which need to be implemented.\n- **Performance Considerations:** While iPads have powerful chips (M series), optimizing performance on a mobile device is crucial.\n- **Apple's Security and App Store Policies:** These policies, particularly regarding code signing and the loading of dynamic libraries, pose limitations on supporting features like third-party C++ GD Extensions.\n- **Swift UI as the Solution:** The Xogot project leverages **Swift UI** to build a native iPad user interface. The key advantage of Swift UI, according to Miguel de Icaza, is its declarative approach and focus on a \"source of truth,\" which simplifies UI updates based on data model changes.\n- **LibGodot:** A fundamental component of Xogot is the use of **libgodot.a**, a modular build of the Godot core engine. This allows Xogot to embed Godot views and content within the Swift UI application, enabling the mixing of native and engine elements.\n- **Virtualization of Godot State:** A significant technical achievement discussed is the virtualization of Godot's global state. This allows the Xogot application to run both the editor and a game instance simultaneously by \"ping-ponging\" a variable that points to the respective state.\n- \"essentially every time that there's an access to a global variable... it would allocate it and instead what I did is I would have a big ass variable that contained the state of the whole app\"\n- \"and the trick is all you got to do is change that jro variable so J points there it's the editor then you change it and it points there and now it's the game\"\n- **Reorganizing the UI for iPad:** To address the limitations and expectations of the iPad, the Xogot UI is being significantly redesigned. This includes:\n- Rewriting high-traffic dialogues in Swift UI.\n- Simplifying or removing features from the editor UI to save space, with the understanding that users can return to the desktop version for full configuration.\n- Adjusting the visual presentation of elements like font data.\n- **Limitations of Xogot:** Due to Apple's policies and the project's current stage:\n- Only **GDScript** is supported as the scripting language.\n- **Third-party C++ GD Extensions are not supported**, as dynamically loading code is restricted. Popular extensions may be bundled in the future.\n- Support for **C# GD Extensions** is also limited due to the need for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which is generally restricted on iOS.\n- **Ongoing Development and Beta Testing:** The Discord conversations demonstrate active development, bug fixing, and beta testing with a community of users. Users are reporting bugs related to various aspects of the editor and engine, such as:\n- Invalid states in animations.\n- Issues with TileSets and TileMaps.\n- Crashes related to script editor tabs.\n- Visual bugs in the UI.\n- Problems with specific nodes and their properties (e.g., Label tab stop values, ColorRect).\n- Performance concerns, particularly on lower-end iPads.\n- Trouble with procedural sound generation.\n- **Features Being Implemented and Explored:** The team is actively working on and discussing various features:\n- Implementing native editors for different Godot components (TileSet, TileMapLayer, Animation, Debugger, Output).\n- Improving visual editors (e.g., for shaders, curves, gradients).\n- Adding paint functionality to the TileSet editor.\n- Supporting running games embedded within the editor.\n- Implementing features for managing projects and assets (e.g., rescanning the file system, supporting addons).\n- Adding support for external displays.\n- Exploring support for running local LLMs.\n- Considering support for Vision Pro and iPhone (though iPhone support is seen as more challenging due to the need for a full experience).\n- Discussing the implementation of Feature Tags for conditional code based on platform or configuration.\n- **Monetization and Future Vision:** There are discussions about the future of Xogot, including its potential cost and target audience. While there is testing of a paywall in the beta (with no actual charges), the final monetization model is not yet decided. Miguel de Icaza's vision seems to be more than just a simple port, aiming for an Apple Design Award and providing a robust game development experience on the iPad. There is also excitement about the potential for **embedding Godot scenes within native iOS/Android/Mac apps using libgodot**.\n\n**3.

It aims to bring the full Godot editor and development experience to mobile devices.\n\n#### How does Xogot differ from the standard Godot editor?\n\n- While Xogot uses the core Godot editor functionalities (through libgodot.a and creative use of GD extensions), it features a completely rewritten user interface using Swift UI. This new UI is optimized for touch input and the constraints of a mobile device, with larger tap targets and a focus on a more streamlined experience. It intentionally removes some configuration options deemed less essential for a mobile workflow, assuming users can utilize the desktop version for more advanced settings if needed.\n\n#### What programming languages are supported in Xogot?\n\n- Currently, only GDScript is officially supported in Xogot. Due to Apple's security restrictions, dynamic libraries (like those used by C++ GD extensions) are not allowed to be added after the application is approved for the App Store. There are plans to potentially bundle popular C++ extensions directly into the Xogot binary in the future. C# is also not currently supported, likely due to limitations with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation on iOS.\n\n#### Can I use my existing Godot projects with Xogot?\n\n- Yes, you can use your existing Godot projects with Xogot. You can transfer your project folder to the iPad and open it in the Xogot application. Projects created in the desktop version of Godot can be opened and edited in Xogot, and vice-versa.\n\n#### Are there any limitations to using Xogot compared to the desktop version?\n\n- Yes, there are some limitations. As mentioned, only GDScript is currently supported, and third-party C++ GD extensions cannot be dynamically loaded. The UI is also streamlined, meaning some advanced configuration options might be missing or presented differently. There have also been reports of some specific functionalities, like certain animation properties, TileSet/TileMap editing nuances, and debugger output, still being refined and having some bugs or limitations compared to the desktop version.\n\n#### What is the licensing model for Xogot?\n\n- The Xogot application is currently in a beta testing phase via TestFlight. While there have been discussions and testing of in-app purchases and a \"paywall\" during the beta, any purchases made during this phase do not actually charge the user. The final pricing and monetization strategy for Xogot have not been officially announced, but the developers are aware of community concerns about pricing and sustainability. The core Godot engine and the assets included in the KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-FPS, which Xogot builds upon, are released under permissive licenses (MIT and CC0 respectively).\n\n#### How can I get access to the Xogot beta?\n\n- The Xogot beta is available through Apple's TestFlight program. You need to sign up using a form, typically providing your TestFlight ID or Apple ID. Invites are sent out in batches, so there might be a waiting period after signing up. Information regarding the sign-up process is usually shared within the Xogot community channels (like Discord).\n\n#### What are the main goals of the Xogot project?\n\n- The primary goal of Xogot is to provide a powerful and user-friendly Godot editor experience on the iPad (and eventually iPhone). This involves adapting the existing Godot core to the mobile environment, creating a touch-optimized UI, and ensuring compatibility with desktop Godot projects. The project also aims to utilize and contribute back to the Godot engine itself, such as integrating Metal rendering backend support. There's also a desire to cater to both existing Godot developers who want to work on the go and potentially new developers looking for a mobile-friendly game development tool.\n\n---\n\n### Integration Note\n\nHello! I am here to act as your paid consultant and thought partner, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you've provided to help you quickly analyze information and develop strategic recommendations. I have access to excerpts from the Xogot App Store release notes, documentation on differences between Xogot and Godot, Godot export documentation for iOS, Xogot FAQ, Xogot Getting Started guides, Reddit discussions about Godot on mobile and iOS, Godot 4.4 documentation, Xogot documentation on various topics like UI, assets, controls, TestFlight notes, a blog post about Xogot on iPadOS, Product Hunt reviews, the Xogot App Store listing, and Discord chat logs related to Xogot features, bugs, and discussions. I can help you navigate these materials, understand complex topics, and formulate well-supported insights.\n\nXogot is designed to integrate closely with existing Godot development workflows and tools, aiming to provide a native iPad experience that complements, rather than replaces, desktop Godot usage. The core principle is to build upon the powerful, open-source Godot engine, making it accessible and effective on a touch-first device like the iPad.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of how Xogot integrates with existing Godot workflows and tools:\n\n1. **Project Compatibility and Mobility**: A fundamental aspect of Xogot's integration is project compatibility. Projects created in Xogot are intended to be fully compatible with the desktop edition of Godot. This allows users to move projects back and forth between the two platforms.\n   - **Importing Projects**: Existing Godot projects can be brought into Xogot using the Files App integration. This involves saving project files to a location accessible by the Files App (like iCloud Drive) and then copying them into the Xogot folder on the iPad. If the project is large, re-importing assets can take some time.\n   - **Using Version Control**: Xogot recommends using native iOS Git clients like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. Users can clone repositories directly into the Xogot projects area or add existing project folders in Xogot as linked repositories in Working Copy. Pushing changes and using linked folders with Working Copy requires a Pro unlock. While Xogot itself does not have native Git support, this workflow allows users to manage their Godot projects with Git on the iPad.\n   - **Exporting Projects**: Xogot currently supports exporting projects to WebAssembly, which can be shared via a link for playtesting in a web browser. Other export options, such as exporting for iOS (which requires a macOS machine and Xcode), Android, Windows, or other platforms, must be done using Godot on the desktop. The process for exporting a Godot project to Xcode for iOS development involves using the Godot editor's export window on macOS, setting up required Apple Developer account information, and then building and deploying from Xcode. For active development, Godot project files can be linked directly into an Xcode project to avoid re-exporting after every change.\n2. **User Interface and Experience**: Xogot's UI is a significant area of adaptation from standard Godot. It is specifically designed to be touch-friendly and align with iPadOS conventions.\n   - **iPadOS Adaptation**: This includes making UI elements more tappable, simplifying parts of the interface to conserve screen real estate, and replacing some toolbar icons with Apple's SF Symbols. Tooltips, which rely on hovering, are not surfaced due to the iPad's touch interface.\n   - **Hybrid UI Approach**: Instead of fully rewriting the entire Godot editor UI in SwiftUI, Xogot uses a hybrid approach. It has a native SwiftUI shell that embeds Godot views as a library (libgodot). High-traffic or critical dialogues are being rewritten natively in SwiftUI for a better touch experience, such as the TileSet and TileMapLayer editors, the Audio bus editor, and the Shader Editor. Less frequently used or plugin-specific UI elements might still embed the original Godot views.\n   - **Differences from Godot UI**: While aiming for a native feel, this results in some differences from the desktop Godot UI. For example, Project Settings navigation is adapted. Some users miss the classic Godot node icons, though Xogot offers an option to use them instead of SF Symbols. There are ongoing discussions and work based on user feedback to tune the UI and bring back or adapt features for a better workflow on iPad.\n3. **Supported Scripting and Extensions**: A key difference and limitation in Xogot compared to desktop Godot is the supported scripting languages and extensions.\n   - **GDScript Only**: Xogot exclusively supports Godot's built-in scripting language, GDScript.\n   - **No Compiled Languages**: Support for other compiled languages like C#, C++, Swift, or Rust is not included in Xogot. This means projects or addons written in these languages are unlikely to work directly in Xogot. While Godot 4.2+ experimentally supports exporting C# projects to iOS, this is a function of the desktop editor, not Xogot itself. Adding support for C# or arbitrary compiled GDExtensions in Xogot is not currently planned due to technical hurdles related to Apple's policies on arbitrary code execution and toolchain inclusion.\n   - **GDScript Addons**: Addons and plugins written solely in GDScript are supported and can be enabled via project settings. Users place the addon code in the 'addons' directory within the project folder.\n4. **Editor Functionality**: Xogot provides access to most core Godot editor functionalities, adapted for the iPad experience.\n   - **Editors**: Includes dedicated editors for 2D and 3D scenes, a script editor, animation editor, and tilemap/tileset editors. Recent improvements have focused on native SwiftUI rewrites for key editors like TileSet and TileMapLayer.\n   - **Inspector and Settings**: The Inspector and Project Settings panels are available, with some UI adaptations for iPad. All Project Settings from Godot are intended to be available, though the UI for navigating them is different.\n   - **Debugger**: A fully integrated debugger is included, supporting breakpoints, exploring program state, and profiling. Runtime errors are surfaced with descriptions.\n   - **Asset Importing**: Supports common asset types (sprites, textures, sounds, 3D models) and provides multiple ways to import them directly on the iPad via Files App or drag and drop. Specific formats like .gltf and .obj for 3D models are supported with notes on required accompanying files.\n   - **Input Handling**: Provides support for various input devices, including external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers. A notable feature is the built-in iOS virtual controller, which maps to Xbox button conventions and can be configured via the Input Map in Project Settings. This allows quick testing of desktop projects on iPad without requiring custom touch controls. Users can also manually add touch controls like the Virtual Joystick Addon. There have been reports and fixes related to multi-touch event handling in the editor and running games. Support for accelerometer/gyroscope is available but might require exporting the game to test fully.\n   - **Rendering**: Xogot is based on Godot 4.4+. It supports Godot's rendering engines (Metal, Vulkan) and rendering methods (Mobile, Forward+, OpenGL), configurable in Project Settings. Metal backend support is integrated.\n   - **External Displays and Multitasking**: Supports iPadOS multitasking features like Split View and Stage Manager, allowing work across multiple displays.\n5. **Learning Resources**: Xogot includes integrated learning resources to help users get started.\n   - **Documentation**: Provides integrated API documentation and tutorials. This includes Xogot-specific guides (like Getting Started, UI, Importing Assets, Onscreen Controls, Working with Git) and documentation on differences from Godot. Links to the official Godot documentation are also beneficial.\n   - **Sample Projects**: Comes preloaded with sample projects in the \"Learning Center\" to help users explore features.\n\nIn summary, Xogot functions as a Godot editor specifically tailored for iPadOS. It maintains project compatibility with desktop Godot, allowing developers to seamlessly transition their work. While it adapts the UI for touch and leverages native iOS features, it currently focuses on GDScript and doesn't support compiled languages or arbitrary GDExtensions, requiring desktop Godot for projects dependent on these. Core editor functionalities are present and being actively refined for the touch environment, alongside built-in learning resources.\n\nAs a next step, considering the focus on compatibility and the unique iPad workflow, you might want to investigate the specific performance characteristics of Xogot compared to desktop Godot for different types of projects (e.g., 2D vs 3D, asset heavy vs code heavy) to understand the practical limitations and ideal use cases for developing solely or partially on iPad.\n\n### Technical Considerations and Limitations Note\n\nAs your paid consultant and thought partner, I will now detail the unique technical considerations and limitations when using Xogot, drawing upon the documentation and conversation history you've provided. I have access to a range of materials including release notes, documentation on differences and features, Godot export guides, Reddit discussions, and Discord chat logs, which allow me to analyze Xogot from technical, operational, and user perspective.\n\nXogot is built upon the robust Godot engine but is specifically engineered for the iPadOS environment, which introduces several technical considerations and limitations that differ from the standard desktop Godot experience. These considerations are primarily driven by the architecture of iPadOS, Apple's platform policies, and the design choices made to optimize for a touch-first interface.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the unique technical considerations and limitations:\n\n1. **Core Architecture and Process Management:**\n   - Xogot employs a hybrid architecture, using a native SwiftUI shell to embed Godot engine views via `libgodot`. This approach allows for a more native iPadOS feel while leveraging the core Godot functionality.\n   - A major technical hurdle overcome was the iPadOS restriction on running multiple processes simultaneously. Unlike the desktop Godot editor, which launches a separate process for running a game, iPadOS does not allow a child process to run alongside the parent application.\n   - To address this, the Xogot team had to \"virtualize\" Godot, modifying its core to allow multiple instances to run within a single application process. Early attempts involved manually resetting the entire Godot state when switching between the editor and running the game. A more robust solution was achieved by making Godot's root singleton thread-local storage and managing separate graphics contexts. This complex adaptation ensures the editor and the running game can coexist within the same application, enabling features like the integrated debugger.\n2. **Scripting Language Support (Limited to GDScript):**\n   - A significant limitation is that Xogot exclusively supports Godot's built-in scripting language, GDScript.\n   - Compiled languages such as C#, C++, Swift, or Rust are *not* supported. The technical challenge here is substantial; supporting languages like Swift would require embedding the entire Swift compiler and toolchain within the app, which is not currently planned. Godot's recent transition from Mono to CoreCLR further complicates C# support specifically for the iOS platform.\n3. **GDExtension and Plugin Support (GDScript Only):**\n   - Related to scripting, Xogot only supports addons and plugins written purely in GDScript.\n   - Compiled GDExtensions written in languages like C++ or C# are *not* supported. This limitation stems from Apple's App Store policies, which generally prohibit applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries for security reasons.\n   - For popular GDExtensions to work in Xogot, they would need to be specifically ported to be multi-instance compatible and then potentially bundled directly within the Xogot application binary after careful consideration and porting efforts. Users have voiced interest in support for specific extensions like Godot-Jolt and Godot-Voxel.\n4. **User Interface Adaptation and Hybrid Implementation:**\n   - While Xogot is built on Godot, its user interface is heavily adapted for iPadOS to be touch-friendly, leading to differences compared to the desktop editor. This involves larger tappable regions, simplified layouts, and the use of SF Symbols instead of standard Godot icons in many places.\n   - Not all parts of the UI have been rewritten in SwiftUI. High-traffic areas like the TileSet, TileMapLayer, Audio bus, and Shader editors are being rebuilt natively for a better touch experience. However, less frequently used components or third-party plugins may still display the original Godot UI, resulting in a sometimes inconsistent visual style.\n   - Certain interactions common in desktop Godot may be missing or adapted. For example, tooltips are not available due to the lack of hover on touch devices. Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported with an external keyboard, but some desktop interactions like tabbing between inspector properties can be tricky to implement in the adapted UI. Users have also noted differences in behaviors like dragging objects accidentally triggering other editor windows.\n5. **Performance and Memory Constraints:**\n   - Memory usage is a key limitation on iPads, particularly for larger projects or on devices with less RAM. Users have reported low memory warnings and crashes, especially with projects that run many print statements or are generally asset-heavy.\n   - There have been ongoing efforts to reduce memory consumption and fix leaks. Memory spiking when the app is sent to the background was identified as a cause of crashes.\n   - While modern M-series chips on iPads offer significant processing power, available RAM appears to be a more critical factor for smooth performance in Xogot.\n6. **Input Handling Specificities:**\n   - Xogot supports external keyboards, mice, and Bluetooth controllers, providing a familiar experience for desktop users.\n   - A unique iOS-only feature is the built-in virtual controller, configurable in Project Settings. This maps to Xbox conventions and allows for testing games designed for controllers without implementing custom touch controls. However, it offers less customization than using a GDScript-based virtual joystick addon.\n   - Handling multi-touch input in both the editor and running games has presented challenges, with bugs reported regarding simultaneous touch events and the distinction between raw touches and pan/magnification gestures. The input system has been modified and is not the same as vanilla Godot, which impacts upstreaming fixes.\n   - Apple Pencil support is present, allowing for fine detail work, but features like hover input may not be fully supported by Godot itself.\n7. **File System Integration and Version Control Workflow:**\n   - Xogot leverages the iPadOS Files App for project and asset import/export. This allows transferring projects via iCloud Drive, local storage (\"On My iPad\"), or connected external drives. Drag and drop is supported for assets.\n   - While projects can be saved to external locations, direct integration with cloud storage like iCloud Drive required adopting complex asynchronous File IO APIs and was not initially fully supported for saving.\n   - Xogot does *not* have built-in Git support. The recommended workflow involves using a separate native iOS Git client like Working Copy, which integrates with the Files App. This requires using features like cloning into the Xogot folder or adding the project folder as a linked repository. Some advanced Git features require a Pro unlock in Working Copy. Command-line Git can also be used via an iSH terminal with mounting the Xogot directory.\n   - A potential pitfall when moving projects between desktop OSes (Windows/Mac, which are typically case-insensitive) and iPadOS (which is case-sensitive) is issues arising from inconsistent file or folder casing.\n8. **Exporting and Deployment Limitations:**\n   - Currently, Xogot supports exporting projects to WebAssembly for playtesting via a hosted link. This feature hosts the build on `share.xogot.com` for a limited time.\n   - Exporting to other platforms (such as native iOS apps, Android, Windows, etc.) must be done using the desktop version of Godot. The process for building a native iOS app from a Godot project requires a macOS machine, Xcode, export templates, and an Apple Developer account. Direct native iOS app building/deployment from Xogot is not a current feature, although it is a desired capability. The \"Export\" option in Xogot currently initiates iOS and WebAssembly exports.\n9. **Device and OS Version Requirements:**\n   - Xogot requires iPadOS 18.0 or later and an iPad with an A12 Bionic chip or newer. This is due to reliance on APIs introduced in iOS/iPadOS 17 and extensively in 18.\n   - Older iPadOS versions are not supported.\n   - While the app can be installed and partially used on iPhones running iOS 18, the UI is not optimized for smaller screens, and some features may not work correctly.\n   - It runs on VisionPro as the iPad app, not a dedicated build.\n\nThese technical considerations mean that while Xogot offers a powerful Godot development experience on the iPad, it functions best as part of a larger workflow that may still require a desktop machine for tasks like building final native apps or utilizing plugins written in compiled languages. The ongoing development is actively addressing many of these points, particularly around UI native-ness and core editor functionality adapted for touch and memory constraints.\n\nConsidering these points, a potential next step for analysis could be to delve into how these specific technical limitations translate into workflow friction for different user segments (e.g., hobbyists, professional indies, developers building plugins or using advanced features) and identify which limitations are most critical for improving the value proposition of Xogot as a standalone development environment.\n\n### Version Control and Collaboration Note\n\nAs your paid consultant and thought partner, let's delve into how Xogot approaches version control and collaboration for Godot projects, drawing upon the information available in the sources you've provided. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for assessing workflow efficiency and scalability, which can inform strategic recommendations.\n\nXogot enables version control and collaboration for Godot projects primarily by leveraging the native file management capabilities of iPadOS and recommending the use of external, dedicated applications for Git integration. It does not feature a built-in Git client within the application itself, a decision influenced by the technical constraints and platform policies of iPadOS.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of how this is facilitated and the considerations involved:\n\n1. **Leveraging iPadOS Files App Integration:**\n   - The foundation of Xogot's approach lies in its deep integration with the iPadOS Files App. This allows users to store their Godot projects and assets in locations accessible by other apps on the iPad, such as iCloud Drive, \"On My iPad\" storage, or connected external drives.\n   - This integration means that the actual project files (`.godot` folder, `.tscn`, `.gd`, `.png`, etc.) reside within the standard iPadOS file system, making them visible and manageable by any application that can interact with files in those locations.\n2. **Recommended Method: External Git Clients (Specifically Working Copy):**\n   - Because Xogot itself does not include Git functionality, the recommended workflow for version control involves using a separate, native iOS Git client. Working Copy is explicitly endorsed and recommended for this purpose.\n   - Working Copy integrates seamlessly with the Files App, allowing it to access and manage the project files stored in the Xogot folder or other locations accessible via Files.\n   - To use Working Copy with a Xogot project, users can either clone a Git repository directly into the Xogot folder using Working Copy, or add an existing Xogot project folder as a \"Linked Repository\" within Working Copy.\n   - This enables users to perform standard Git operations – such as committing changes, pushing to and fetching from remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab), branching, etc. – using the Working Copy interface. Xogot automatically reflects file changes made by Working Copy due to the Files App integration.\n   - It is noted that certain advanced features in Working Copy, like pushing changes and using linked folders, may require a \"Pro\" unlock.\n   - Users have confirmed that they successfully use this workflow with services like GitHub.\n3. **Alternative Method: Command-Line Git via iSH:**\n   - For users who are comfortable with command-line interfaces, the documentation also suggests using iSH, a Linux shell emulator for iPadOS, to manage Git repositories.\n   - This involves installing Git within iSH, mounting the Xogot project directory to the iSH file system, and then running standard Git commands from the iSH terminal within that mounted directory.\n4. **Reasoning for No Built-in Git:**\n   - The decision not to include a built-in Git client or support traditional Godot Git plugins stems from the architectural limitations and security policies of iPadOS and the Apple App Store.\n   - Apple's policies generally restrict applications from loading arbitrary third-party dynamic libraries or executing arbitrary code from outside the app's sandbox. This makes it technically challenging, if not impossible under standard App Store distribution, to bundle and run a generic Git client library or Godot's desktop-style Git plugin within the Xogot app.\n   - Additionally, the core changes made to Godot to run within a single process on iPadOS, allowing the editor and game to coexist (\"virtualizing\" Godot), likely impact how tightly integrated external tools like Git plugins could be.\n5. **Implications for Collaboration:**\n   - This file-system-based approach, combined with external Git clients, directly supports collaborative workflows. Teams can store their Godot project in a shared Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).\n   - Developers using Xogot on their iPads can pull the latest changes from the repository, work on the project locally using Xogot, and then commit and push their changes back to the shared repository using their Git client (like Working Copy).\n   - This allows multiple team members, whether they are using Xogot on iPad or desktop Godot on Windows, macOS, or Linux, to contribute to the same project. Projects created in Xogot are compatible with desktop Godot and vice versa.\n   - The \"Share Your Work\" feature, which exports projects to WebAssembly for easy playtesting via a hosted link, also facilitates a form of collaboration by enabling rapid feedback loops on playable builds, although it's not direct code collaboration.\n6. **Limitations and Considerations:**\n   - **No In-Editor Git UI:** A significant limitation compared to desktop IDEs or the standard Godot editor with a Git plugin is the lack of a fully integrated Git user interface within Xogot itself. Users must switch to a separate app (Working Copy or iSH) to perform version control operations.\n   - **Case Sensitivity:** A potential pitfall when collaborating on projects stored in Git and shared between desktop operating systems (like Windows or macOS, often case-insensitive file systems) and iPadOS (a case-sensitive file system) is that inconsistent casing in file or folder names can lead to issues or errors when opening or running the project on iPadOS. Users have reported encountering errors related to this when importing projects.\n   - **Workflow Friction:** The necessity of using external apps adds steps to the development workflow compared to environments with integrated Git.\n\nIn summary, Xogot enables version control and collaboration by relying on standard iPadOS file management and external Git applications. While it lacks built-in Git features due to platform constraints, this approach facilitates interoperability with desktop Godot workflows and allows teams to use established Git-based collaboration models.\n\nA potential next step in analysis could be to evaluate the degree of workflow friction introduced by this external Git dependency for typical Godot development tasks (e.g., committing frequently, resolving merge conflicts) and how this might impact the appeal of Xogot as a primary development environment compared to a supplementary one for on-the-go work.\n",

Ruby’s built-in <code>Time</code> and <code>DateTime</code> classes already handle UTC and local time well. However, for time zones, Ruby doesn’t have direct support for converting between named timezones like &ldquo;PST&rdquo; or &ldquo;EST&rdquo; without a library like <code>tzinfo</code>.</p>\n<p>You can still implement the core functionality using built-in Ruby classes by limiting the time zone support to a few common ones (like UTC, GMT, PST, EST) and hardcoding their offsets. This way, there won’t be any dependencies, and you can still have basic timezone support.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-free-ruby-script\">Dependency-Free Ruby Script</h3>\n<p>Here’s a revised version of

I'm 30 years old and still have yet to make it through a single one of those awesome list tutorials for Python that are so easy peasy for you digital lourds. \n\nIn what I imagine to be the manifestation of many a folk's worst nightmare LLM scenario, I asked regular olé free Gee Pee Tee to help me do something I've aspired to do (though invested little effort in, obviously:) creating my first command line application, and found it to be immediately effective! Within the minutes that spanned the conversation below - following the heinous monstrosity's instructions almost verbatim - I had actually published [my first PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/davodtime/)!\n\n`pip install davodtime`\n\n---\n\n*Please note: the following is a conversation with an LLM.*\n\n## [Create Davodtime CLI](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e51b70-ac30-8009-adc6-b0b70a9a0aad)\n\n#### You:\nPlease help me create a command line application (ideally, using a programming language/platform which will be supported on both my macOS-running machine and within the a-Shell app on my iPad) which returns outputs based on arguments I will specify.\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nTo create a cross-platform command line application that works on both macOS and within the a-Shell app on your iPad, I recommend using Python. Python is a versatile and widely supported language that runs on both platforms without much modification.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. **Setup Python**\n\n- **macOS:** Python 3 is typically pre-installed.

Input: `davodtime utc` returns the current UTC time in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss in the command line.\n\n2. Input: `davodtiime` (no arguments) defaults to returning the local system time in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n...and so on, with GMT and standard abbreviations for timezones supported as arguments.\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nHere's how you can create the `davodtime` command line application using Python. This application will support the functionality you've described, and it will work on both macOS and within the a-Shell app on your iPad.\n\n### Step 1: Write the Python Script\n\nCreate a Python script called `davodtime.py` with the following content:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\n\ndef format_time(dt):\n    return dt.strftime('%m%d%Y-%H%M%S')\n\ndef get_time_for_timezone(tz_name):\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(tz_name)\n        return format_time(datetime.now(tz))\n    except pytz.UnknownTimeZoneError:\n        return f\"Unknown timezone: {tz_name}\"\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) == 1:\n        # No arguments, return local system time\n        print(format_time(datetime.now()))\n    else:\n        arg = sys.argv[1].lower()\n        if arg == \"utc\":\n            print(format_time(datetime.utcnow()))\n        else:\n            print(get_time_for_timezone(arg.upper()))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nSince this script uses the `pytz` library to handle timezones, you'll need to install it if it’s not already installed.\n\nOn macOS, you can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip3 install pytz\n```\n\nIn a-Shell, you can install it by running:\n\n```bash\npip install pytz\n```\n\n### Step 3: Make the Script Executable and Installable\n\nTo make the script executable and accessible as `davodtime`, follow these steps:\n\n#### On macOS:\n\n1. **Make the script executable**:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/davodtime.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Move or link the script to a directory in your `PATH`**:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /path/to/davodtime.py /usr/local/bin/davodtime\n   ```\n\n#### In a-Shell:\n\n1. **Make the script executable**:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/davodtime.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Create an alias in your shell profile**:\n   Add this line to `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` (depending on your setup):\n   ```bash\n   alias davodtime='python3 /path/to/davodtime.py'\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Usage\n\n- **UTC Time**:\n  ```bash\n  davodtime utc\n  ```\n\n- **Local Time (default)**:\n  ```bash\n  davodtime\n  ```\n\n- **Other Timezones** (e.g., GMT, PST, EST):\n  ```bash\n  davodtime gmt\n  davodtime pst\n  ```\n\nThis script will handle time conversion for most standard timezone abbreviations using the `pytz` library, and the output will always be in the `MMddYYYY-HHmmss` format.\n\nWould you like any further modifications or explanations on this setup?\n\n\n#### You:\nHow would I publish the script to pypi.org?\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nPublishing your script to [PyPI (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/) involves a few steps. Below is a guide to help you package your `davodtime` script and publish it to PyPI.\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Project Directory\n\n1. **Create a project directory**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir davodtime\n   cd davodtime\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the following structure**:\n   ```\n   davodtime/\n   ├── davodtime/\n   │   ├── __init__.py\n   │   └── main.py\n   ├── setup.py\n   ├── LICENSE\n   └── README.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Move your script**:\n   Move your `davodtime.py` script to the `davodtime` directory and rename it to `main.py`.\n\n4. **Create an `__init__.py` file**:\n   This file can be empty, but it's necessary to make the `davodtime` directory a package.\n\n### Step 2: Write the `setup.py` File\n\nThe `setup.py` file is the script used to build and distribute your package. Here's an example for `davodtime`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"davodtime\",\n    version=\"0.1.0\",\n    author=\"Your Name\",\n    author_email=\"your.email@example.com\",\n    description=\"A command-line tool to display time in various formats.\",\n    long_description=open(\"README.md\").read(),\n    long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\",\n    url=\"https://github.com/yourusername/davodtime\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=[\n        \"pytz\",\n    ],\n    entry_points={\n        \"console_scripts\": [\n            \"davodtime=davodtime.main:main\",\n        ],\n    },\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n        \"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\",\n        \"Operating System :: OS Independent\",\n    ],\n    python_requires=\">=3.6\",\n)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write a `README.md` File\n\nCreate a `README.md` file that describes your project. This will be displayed on the PyPI page for your package.\n\n### Step 4: Choose a License\n\nAdd a `LICENSE` file to your project directory. If you’re unsure, you might consider the MIT License. Here's an example:\n\n```text\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 Your Name\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n... (complete text of MIT License)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Build Your Package\n\nBefore uploading, you need to build your package. Ensure you have `setuptools` and `wheel` installed:\n\n```bash\npip install setuptools wheel\n```\n\nThen, run the following command in your project directory:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nThis will create a `dist/` directory containing the files necessary for distribution.\n\n### Step 6: Upload to PyPI\n\n1. **Install `twine`**:\n   Twine is the recommended tool for uploading Python packages to PyPI.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install twine\n   ```\n\n2. **Upload your package**:\n   Use Twine to upload your package to PyPI:\n\n   ```bash\n   twine upload dist/*\n   ```\n\n   You will be prompted for your PyPI username and password.\n\n### Step 7: Verify the Upload\n\nAfter uploading, your package should be available at `https://pypi.org/project/davodtime/`. You can also install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install davodtime\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Versioning**: Be sure to update the version number in `setup.py` every time you upload a new version.\n- **Testing**: You can test your package upload by using the PyPI test server at <https://test.pypi.org/>.\n\nThis process will make your `davodtime` script easily installable and usable by others. Let me know if you need any more details or help!\n\n\n#### You:\nCan you generate a comprehensive manpage for the script? Would that be included in the pypi dist?\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nSure! I'll help you create a comprehensive `man` page for your `davodtime` script. I'll also explain how to include it in your PyPI distribution.\n\n### Step 1: Write the Man Page\n\nMan pages are typically written in a format called **troff** or **groff**. Here's an example `davodtime.1` man page:\n\n```troff\n.TH DAVODTIME 1 \"August 2024\" \"Version 0.1.0\" \"User Commands\"\n\n.SH NAME\ndavodtime \\- A command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n.B davodtime\n[\\fButc\\fR | \\fIGMT\\fR | \\fITZ\\fR]\n\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.B davodtime\nis a command-line utility that displays the current time in various time zones or formats.\n\n.SH OPTIONS\n.TP\n.B utc\nDisplays the current UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\n.B TZ\nAny standard timezone abbreviation (e.g., GMT, PST, EST) can be provided as an argument to display the current time in that timezone, in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.SH EXAMPLES\n.TP\n.B davodtime\nDisplays the local system time.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime utc\nDisplays the current time in UTC.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime pst\nDisplays the current time in Pacific Standard Time.\n\n.SH AUTHOR\nYour Name <your.email@example.com>\n\n.SH LICENSE\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.B date(1)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install the Man Page Locally\n\nTo install the man page locally on macOS, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a directory for custom man pages** (if it doesn't already exist):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1\n   ```\n\n2. **Copy the man page**:\n   ```bash\n   cp davodtime.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/davodtime.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Update the man database** (optional, usually not required on macOS):\n   ```bash\n   man -w\n   ```\n\n4. **View the man page**:\n   ```bash\n   man davodtime\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Include the Man Page in Your PyPI Distribution\n\nTo include the man page in your PyPI distribution, you'll need to adjust your `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` files.\n\n#### 3.1. Modify `setup.py`:\n\nUpdate the `setup.py` to include the man page in your package data:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nimport os\n\ndef get_data_files():\n    data_files = []\n    if os.name == 'posix':\n        data_files.append(('share/man/man1', ['davodtime.1']))\n    return data_files\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"davodtime\",\n    version=\"0.1.0\",\n    author=\"Your Name\",\n    author_email=\"your.email@example.com\",\n    description=\"A command-line tool to display time in various formats.\",\n    long_description=open(\"README.md\").read(),\n    long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\",\n    url=\"https://github.com/yourusername/davodtime\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=[\n        \"pytz\",\n    ],\n    data_files=get_data_files(),\n    entry_points={\n        \"console_scripts\": [\n            \"davodtime=davodtime.main:main\",\n        ],\n    },\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n        \"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\",\n        \"Operating System :: OS Independent\",\n    ],\n    python_requires=\">=3.6\",\n)\n```\n\n#### 3.2. Create `MANIFEST.in`:\n\nAdd a `MANIFEST.in` file to include the man page in the distribution:\n\n```text\ninclude davodtime.1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Build and Upload\n\nRebuild your distribution and upload it to PyPI:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n\n### Step 5: Installing the Man Page with Your Package\n\nWhen users install your package, they can manually copy the man page to the appropriate directory (e.g., `/usr/local/share/man/man1/`). Automating this process can be complex due to differences in system configurations, so it's often left to the user to place the man page correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis process will give you a comprehensive man page for your `davodtime` tool, which can be installed locally and included in your PyPI distribution. Let me know if you need further assistance!\n\n\n#### You:\nI think we should add support for \"--help\" and \"-h\" arguments. \n\n#### ChatGPT:\nAdding support for `--help` and `-h` arguments is a great idea, as it allows users to quickly understand how to use the `davodtime` tool. We can implement this by checking for these arguments in the `main()` function and displaying the help message accordingly.\n\n### Updated Python Script\n\nHere’s how you can modify your `davodtime.py` script to include support for `--help` and `-h` arguments:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\n\ndef format_time(dt):\n    return dt.strftime('%m%d%Y-%H%M%S')\n\ndef get_time_for_timezone(tz_name):\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(tz_name)\n        return format_time(datetime.now(tz))\n    except pytz.UnknownTimeZoneError:\n        return f\"Unknown timezone: {tz_name}\"\n\ndef print_help():\n    help_text = \"\"\"\nUsage: davodtime [OPTIONS] [TIMEZONE]\n\nA command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help          Show this help message and exit\n  utc                 Display the current time in UTC\n  TIMEZONE            Display the current time in the specified timezone (e.g., GMT, PST, EST)\n\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed.\n\"\"\"\n    print(help_text)\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) == 1:\n        # No arguments, return local system time\n        print(format_time(datetime.now()))\n    else:\n        arg = sys.argv[1].lower()\n        if arg in [\"-h\", \"--help\"]:\n            print_help()\n        elif arg == \"utc\":\n            print(format_time(datetime.utcnow()))\n        else:\n            print(get_time_for_timezone(arg.upper()))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`print_help()` Function**:\n   - This function defines and prints the help message. It describes the usage, available options, and a brief explanation of what each option does.\n\n2. **Checking for `-h` and `--help`**:\n   - In the `main()` function, the script checks if the first argument is `-h` or `--help`. If either is found, it calls the `print_help()` function and exits.\n\n3. **Existing Functionality**:\n   - The existing functionality (handling `utc` and timezone arguments) remains unchanged.\n\n### Testing the Help Functionality\n\nTo test the help functionality, run the script with either `-h` or `--help`:\n\n```bash\ndavodtime -h\ndavodtime --help\n```\n\nBoth commands should display the help text and then exit.\n\n### Updating the Man Page\n\nYou should also update the man page to reflect the new `--help` and `-h` options:\n\n```troff\n.TH DAVODTIME 1 \"August 2024\" \"Version 0.1.0\" \"User Commands\"\n\n.SH NAME\ndavodtime \\- A command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n.B davodtime\n[\\fButc\\fR | \\fIGMT\\fR | \\fITZ\\fR | \\fB-h\\fR | \\fB--help\\fR]\n\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.B davodtime\nis a command-line utility that displays the current time in various time zones or formats.\n\n.SH OPTIONS\n.TP\n.B -h, --help\nDisplays this help message and exits.\n\n.TP\n.B utc\nDisplays the current UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\n.B TZ\nAny standard timezone abbreviation (e.g., GMT, PST, EST) can be provided as an argument to display the current time in that timezone, in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.SH EXAMPLES\n.TP\n.B davodtime\nDisplays the local system time.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime utc\nDisplays the current time in UTC.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime pst\nDisplays the current time in Pacific Standard Time.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime -h\nDisplays the help message.\n\n.SH AUTHOR\nYour Name <your.email@example.com>\n\n.SH LICENSE\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.B date(1)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith these updates, your `davodtime` tool will be more user-friendly, providing essential help information with `-h` or `--help`. The man page is also updated to reflect these changes, making the tool well-documented and easier to use. Let me know if you need further assistance!\n\n\n#### You:\nWould it be possible to generate the same tool using Ruby instead?\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nYes, it’s entirely possible to create the same `davodtime` tool in Ruby. Ruby is well-suited for command-line tools, and it should work both on macOS and a-Shell on iPad. Below is an implementation in Ruby that provides the same functionality as your Python tool.\n\n### Ruby Script\n\nHere's the Ruby version of `davodtime`:\n\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'time'\nrequire 'tzinfo'\n\n# Function to format the time in MMddYYYY-HHmmss format\ndef format_time(time)\n  time.strftime('%m%d%Y-%H%M%S')\nend\n\n# Function to get time for a specific timezone\ndef get_time_for_timezone(tz_name)\n  begin\n    tz = TZInfo::Timezone.get(tz_name)\n    format_time(tz.now)\n  rescue TZInfo::InvalidTimezoneIdentifier\n    \"Unknown timezone: #{tz_name}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Function to display help text\ndef print_help\n  help_text = <<-HELP\nUsage: davodtime [OPTIONS] [TIMEZONE]\n\nA command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help          Show this help message and exit\n  utc                 Display the current time in UTC\n  TIMEZONE            Display the current time in the specified timezone (e.g., GMT, PST, EST)\n\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed.\n  HELP\n\n  puts help_text\nend\n\n# Main function\ndef main\n  if ARGV.empty?\n    # No arguments, return local system time\n    puts format_time(Time.now)\n  else\n    arg = ARGV[0].downcase\n    case arg\n    when '-h', '--help'\n      print_help\n    when 'utc'\n      puts format_time(Time.now.getutc)\n    else\n      puts get_time_for_timezone(arg.upcase)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Run the main function if the script is called directly\nmain if __FILE__ == $0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`format_time(time)`**:\n   - This method formats a `Time` object into the `MMddYYYY-HHmmss` format.\n\n2. **`get_time_for_timezone(tz_name)`**:\n   - This method uses the `tzinfo` gem to look up and display the current time in the specified timezone. If an invalid timezone is provided, it returns an error message.\n\n3. **`print_help()`**:\n   - This method prints the help text, explaining how to use the script.\n\n4. **Main Script Logic**:\n   - The script checks if any arguments are provided. If no arguments are given, it returns the local system time.\n   - If `-h` or `--help` is provided, it prints the help text.\n   - If `utc` is provided, it displays the current UTC time.\n   - For any other argument, it tries to interpret it as a timezone abbreviation and prints the time in that timezone.\n\n### Step 1: Install the `tzinfo` Gem\n\nThis script uses the `tzinfo` library to handle timezones. Install it with:\n\n```bash\ngem install tzinfo\n```\n\n### Step 2: Make the Ruby Script Executable\n\n1. Save the Ruby script as `davodtime.rb`.\n\n2. Make it executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x davodtime.rb\n   ```\n\n3. Move or link the script to a directory in your `PATH`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /path/to/davodtime.rb /usr/local/bin/davodtime\n   ```\n\nNow you can run the script with:\n\n```bash\ndavodtime\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n- **UTC Time**:\n  ```bash\n  davodtime utc\n  ```\n\n- **Local Time (default)**:\n  ```bash\n  davodtime\n  ```\n\n- **Other Timezones** (e.g., GMT, PST, EST):\n  ```bash\n  davodtime gmt\n  davodtime pst\n  ```\n\n- **Help**:\n  ```bash\n  davodtime -h\n  davodtime --help\n  ```\n\n### Man Page (for Ruby Script)\n\nHere's the corresponding man page in **troff** format for the Ruby version of `davodtime`:\n\n```troff\n.TH DAVODTIME 1 \"September 2024\" \"Version 0.1.0\" \"User Commands\"\n\n.SH NAME\ndavodtime \\- A command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n.B davodtime\n[\\fButc\\fR | \\fIGMT\\fR | \\fITZ\\fR | \\fB-h\\fR | \\fB--help\\fR]\n\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.B davodtime\nis a command-line utility that displays the current time in various time zones or formats.\n\n.SH OPTIONS\n.TP\n.B -h, --help\nDisplays this help message and exits.\n\n.TP\n.B utc\nDisplays the current UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\n.B TZ\nAny standard timezone abbreviation (e.g., GMT, PST, EST) can be provided as an argument to display the current time in that timezone, in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.TP\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed in the format MMddYYYY-HHmmss.\n\n.SH EXAMPLES\n.TP\n.B davodtime\nDisplays the local system time.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime utc\nDisplays the current time in UTC.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime pst\nDisplays the current time in Pacific Standard Time.\n\n.TP\n.B davodtime -h\nDisplays the help message.\n\n.SH AUTHOR\nYour Name <your.email@example.com>\n\n.SH LICENSE\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.B date(1)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith this Ruby version, you now have the same `davodtime` functionality as the Python version. The Ruby script is capable of handling timezones, UTC, and default local time, along with `-h` and `--help` arguments. You can also generate the same man page and distribute the tool similarly on both macOS and a-Shell.\n\nLet me know if you need any more information!\n\n\n#### You:\nWould it be possible to do this without any dependencies?\n\n#### ChatGPT:\nYes, it's possible to create the `davodtime` tool in Ruby without using external dependencies like `tzinfo`. Ruby’s built-in `Time` and `DateTime` classes already handle UTC and local time well. However, for time zones, Ruby doesn’t have direct support for converting between named timezones like \"PST\" or \"EST\" without a library like `tzinfo`.\n\nYou can still implement the core functionality using built-in Ruby classes by limiting the time zone support to a few common ones (like UTC, GMT, PST, EST) and hardcoding their offsets. This way, there won’t be any dependencies, and you can still have basic timezone support.\n\n### Dependency-Free Ruby Script\n\nHere’s a revised version of the `davodtime` script without external dependencies:\n\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\n# Function to format time in MMddYYYY-HHmmss format\ndef format_time(time)\n  time.strftime('%m%d%Y-%H%M%S')\nend\n\n# Function to get time for a specific timezone\ndef get_time_for_timezone(tz_name)\n  case tz_name\n  when 'UTC'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc)\n  when 'GMT'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc)\n  when 'PST'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc - (8 * 3600)) # UTC-8\n  when 'EST'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc - (5 * 3600)) # UTC-5\n  when 'CST'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc - (6 * 3600)) # UTC-6\n  when 'MST'\n    format_time(Time.now.getutc - (7 * 3600)) # UTC-7\n  else\n    \"Unknown timezone: #{tz_name}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Function to display help text\ndef print_help\n  help_text = <<-HELP\nUsage: davodtime [OPTIONS] [TIMEZONE]\n\nA command-line tool to display time in various formats.\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help          Show this help message and exit\n  utc                 Display the current time in UTC\n  TIMEZONE            Display the current time in the specified timezone (e.g., GMT, PST, EST)\n\nIf no arguments are provided, the local system time is displayed.\n  HELP\n\n  puts help_text\nend\n\n# Main function\ndef main\n  if ARGV.empty?\n    # No arguments, return local system time\n    puts format_time(Time.now)\n  else\n    arg = ARGV[0].downcase\n    case arg\n    when '-h', '--help'\n      print_help\n    when 'utc'\n      puts format_time(Time.now.getutc)\n    else\n      puts get_time_for_timezone(arg.upcase)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Run the main function if the script is called directly\nmain if __FILE__ == $0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`format_time(time)`**:\n   - This function formats a `Time` object into the `MMddYYYY-HHmmss` format.\n\n2. **Hardcoded Timezone Offsets**:\n   - Instead of using a library to get timezones, we manually calculate the time offsets for some common timezones (`PST`, `EST`, `GMT`, `CST`, `MST`). For example, `PST` is `UTC-8`, so we subtract 8 hours (in seconds) from UTC.\n\n3. **Timezone Support**:\n   - The script now supports the following timezones:\n     - `UTC`: Coordinated Universal Time (no offset)\n     - `GMT`: Same as UTC\n     - `PST`: Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)\n     - `EST`: Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5)\n     - `CST`: Central Standard Time (UTC-6)\n     - `MST`: Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7)\n   - You can easily extend this by adding more timezones with their appropriate offsets.\n\n4. **Help Message**:\n   - The `print_help` function prints the usage information, explaining how to use the tool.\n\n5. **Main Logic**:\n   - If no arguments are provided, the script returns the local system time.\n   - If `utc` is passed, it returns the current UTC time.\n   - If a timezone (e.g., `PST`, `EST`) is passed, it calculates and displays the time for that timezone.\n   - If `-h` or `--help` is passed, it displays the help message.\n\n### Running the Tool\n\nYou can now run this script in the same way as the previous versions:\n\n1. **Local Time** (no arguments):\n   ```bash\n   davodtime\n   ```\n\n2. **UTC Time**:\n   ```bash\n   davodtime utc\n   ```\n\n3. **Specific Timezones** (e.g., PST, EST):\n   ```bash\n   davodtime pst\n   davodtime est\n   ```\n\n4. **Help**:\n   ```bash\n   davodtime -h\n   davodtime --help\n   ```\n\n### Timezone Extension\n\nYou can extend this to support more timezones by adding more cases to the `get_time_for_timezone` function. Just look up the correct UTC offset for the timezone you want to support, and apply it similarly to how the script currently handles `PST` and `EST`.\n\nFor example, to add `IST` (Indian Standard Time, UTC+5:30):\n\n```ruby\nwhen 'IST'\n  format_time(Time.now.getutc + (5 * 3600) + (30 * 60)) # UTC+5:30\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis Ruby version of `davodtime` now works without any external dependencies and still provides basic timezone support for common zones. It’s lightweight and works well on both macOS and a-Shell without needing to install any libraries.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need additional features!\n",

Your observations about the state of Bluetooth keyboard support and documentation for iPhones are insightful and highlight a gap in current resources.\n\n### Current State of Documentation and Support\n\n1. **Bluetooth Keyboard Support on iPhone**:\n   - As you've noted, iPhones do support Bluetooth keyboards, and there is ongoing development in this area. However, the documentation has not kept pace with these developments, particularly since the split of iPadOS from iOS.\n\n2. **Discrepancy in Documentation**:\n   - The documentation for iPad keyboard shortcuts is comprehensive ([Learn iPad keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096)), but there is no equivalent for iPhones. The iPhone User Guide focuses primarily on basic setup and pairing ([iPhone Magic Keyboard pairing](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/magic-keyboard-iph2ced3177/14.0/ios/14.0)).\n\n3. **Developer Awareness**:\n   - Your experience with developers unaware of their apps' Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts on iPhones indicates a need for better communication and documentation from Apple to bridge this knowledge gap.\n\n### Answer to Your Question\n\n**Where can I find complete documentation of both keyboard shortcuts support in native apps/the OS and `UIKeyCommand`’s uniquely-iPhone considerations?**\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a single comprehensive source that documents all the keyboard shortcuts supported on iPhones across native apps and the OS. However, here are some steps and resources that might help:\n\n1. **UIKeyCommand Documentation**:\n   - The [UIKeyCommand](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeycommand) class is the primary resource for developers to implement and understand keyboard shortcuts in their apps. While this documentation doesn't differentiate between iPhone and iPad, the principles apply to both.\n\n2. **Accessibility Features**:\n   - Apple's support pages on accessibility features can provide some insight into keyboard usage on iPhones, particularly for those who use keyboards for accessibility reasons. For example, [Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/full-keyboard-access-iph3e551b4c9/ios) is a feature available on both iPhones and iPads.\n\n3. **Developer Forums and WWDC Sessions**:\n   - Engaging in Apple Developer Forums and watching relevant WWDC sessions can provide additional insights and updates. Sessions such as [this one from WWDC 2021](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10120/) cover many topics related to keyboard navigation and accessibility.\n\n### Recommendations and Next Steps\n\n1. **Feedback to Apple**:\n   - Given your detailed observations and the gaps in documentation, I recommend submitting feedback to Apple through the [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/). Your input could help prioritize better documentation and resources for iPhone keyboard support.\n\n2. **Community Collaboration**:\n   - Consider collaborating with other users and developers to compile a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for iPhones. This could be shared on platforms like GitHub or a dedicated website, providing a valuable resource for the community.\n\n3. **Sharing Your Findings**:\n   - If you have already documented some keyboard shortcuts through your testing, sharing these findings on forums or community platforms could benefit other users facing similar challenges.\n\nThank you again for your question and your efforts in highlighting this important issue. Your initiative is greatly appreciated, and I hope these suggestions help you find the information you need.\n",

Here's a partial interpretation of the decoded content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nColumbia Area Essentials\r\n46900 E O'Rear Rd, Columbia, MO 65202, United States\r\nWild Haven Nature Area\r\n62249 RT-161, Montgomery City, MO 63361, United States\r\nRed's Gas\r\n35495 Peabody Rd, Columbia, MO 65202, United States\r\nBioreactor Landfill Scale\r\n41818 W Worley St, Columbia, MO 65203, United States\r\nColumbia Public Schools\r\nBig Burr Starry Sky Parking\r\n4109 E Stewart Rd, Columbia, MO 65203, United States\r\nCherry Hill Gadweebo\r\nCartwright Circuit\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis suggests that the encoded data is a list of locations, likely with additional metadata such as coordinates or identifiers. However, there are non-printable characters and other binary data interspersed, which indicate this is not a straightforward text encoding but rather a structured format requiring specific decoding logic, likely a protobuf or similar serialization format.\n\n---\n\n<img src=\"https://davidblue.blog/uploads/2024/eastorearrd.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" alt=\"\">\n\nAlso, WTF??\n\n[1] 2014, in iOS 14 Beta.\n",

I&rsquo;d never actually been to Dallas.</p>\n<p>I made very clear to them, I know nothing about your specific city, but I&rsquo;m happy to help if I can because I frankly never seen a really good video investigation in American News into American road safety that reaches a broad audience.</p>\n<p>And they eventually flew me out and they drove, it was kind of funny, they drove me around Dallas and would bring me these like terrible roads like Buckner Avenue.</p>\n<p>If anyone knows Dallas in the east, it&rsquo;s in a lower income, largely Latino neighborhood.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re like, you know, it&rsquo;s just like the classic strode where you&rsquo;ve got a bus stop across the strode and people are like running across it because the nearest crosswalk is a half mile away.</p>\n<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, well, what do you think of this?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>\n<p>This is designed for danger.</p>\n<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what was going to come from it.</p>\n<p>And it was a few weeks later that I saw the series that they put together, which I was so impressed by because they included not just a few snippets from myself.</p>\n<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just one of a bunch of people they included.</p>\n<p>They went all the way to Edmonton, Canada, to look at how road safety could be done much better with sort of bulb outs and with much better leading pedestrian indicators and things like that.</p>\n<p>And they also cornered the head of TxDOT and sort of grilled him about the 85th percentile rule and how he was using that or his agency uses that to set speed limits too high.</p>\n<p>That to me was like such a great moment to see that style of journalism deployed that way.</p>\n<p>But maybe you could also explain what the 85th percentile rule is and why it&rsquo;s such a messed up way to set speed limits.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>So the 85th percentile rule actually was like developed as a concept in the thirties.</p>\n<p>And the idea there was to figure out how to set speed limits in rural areas, but it just sort of got stuck.</p>\n<p>It ended up being plastered all over sort of state DOT policy rules for cities too.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s been a huge problem.</p>\n<p>What the 85th percentile rule is to basically say, it&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like, just go to a given street, record 100 speeds of drivers, and then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many crazies you have that are blowing past that street far faster than is safe for anybody not inside a vehicle, regardless, you just basically pick the 85th person out of a hundred and they set the speed limit for the entire street.</p>\n<p>And that ends up basically making it very difficult to lower speed limits to speeds that are safer for particularly the road users or street users who are outside the vehicle.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>\n<p>And the reporter confronted the head of tech dot on this.</p>\n<p>Can you describe maybe a little bit of what happened there?</p>\n<p>Sure.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>And I myself wasn&rsquo;t there for this, but I did, I was asked about it in the studio and I said, I don&rsquo;t really understand how tech dot says they want to build safe streets, but they&rsquo;re literally lifting the speed limit and some major roads and highways in Dallas, which invariably will make those streets more and roads more dangerous.</p>\n<p>And the reporters in friend BC had concluded speed was going to be sort of like the main topic or the main sort of like pillar of their argument for why Dallas streets are so dangerous.</p>\n<p>And they wanted to talk to the tech dot director, tech stop being in the Texas Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p>And he kept avoiding them.</p>\n<p>The press office was just like putting up a wall.</p>\n<p>So eventually the reporters just went ahead to a public meeting where text that was going to be speaking and they just confronted the director and they forced him to talk to him.</p>\n<p>And they asked him about the 85th percentile and said, oh, we&rsquo;re moving away from that.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re not using that so much anymore.</p>\n<p>And then the reporters to their credit investigated a bit and found text documents that clearly were using the 85th percentile to set the speed limit in Dallas.</p>\n<p>So it was a bit of a gotcha moment that frankly, I enjoyed going to a hospital and asking them why they&rsquo;re still using leeches.</p>\n<p>Like it&rsquo;s this thing that was set in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>And I think very similar to our Donald Shoop episode where he talks about minimum parking requirements of just like this thing that was set and nobody&rsquo;s ever really questioned.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s a sort of pseudoscience that still guides the design of our cities.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s even crazier than leeches because it&rsquo;s like the drivers are doing something illegal and dangerous.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re speeding and we&rsquo;re basically saying like, okay, you guys who are doing something illegal and dangerous get to sort of determine you set the pace, you set the pace, like we&rsquo;re going to base the whole system on the 85th percentile of this illegal thing you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just so nonsensical.</p>\n<p>But David, I&rsquo;m so glad that you were on that piece because sort of like you were saying, a lot of news, especially local news will focus on like crazy drivers and Dallas being as bad as it is, worse than Houston, worse than Phoenix, worse than Los Angeles in terms of road fatalities.</p>\n<p>Does Dallas really have crazier drivers than Phoenix?</p>\n<p>Does Dallas really have crazier drivers than Houston in the same state?</p>\n<p>Seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>What they have are worse roads.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>And frankly, Dallas, I would argue probably has marginally worse roads than some of those other places.</p>\n<p>Like Las Vegas is incredibly dangerous too.</p>\n<p>So is Phoenix, so is Houston.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve solved the problem there.</p>\n<p>But for me, part of the reason why I was happy to spend a couple days in Texas with the reporters and be part of the story, and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was going to turn into.</p>\n<p>It turned out frankly, like far more powerful and better than I expected.</p>\n<p>I was happy to do it because I have the privilege of living in Washington, DC, which is a very expensive city.</p>\n<p>Not coincidentally, it&rsquo;s one of the handful of places in the US like New York, where walking and biking as a main mode of transportation along with transit really is possible.</p>\n<p>Most of this country is more like Dallas.</p>\n<p>And I try to always hold myself accountable and try to remember that most of the United States doesn&rsquo;t look like the city where I live.</p>\n<p>And if we really want to address the road safety problems that we have and solve our transportation issues, frankly, we have to think about the Dallas&rsquo;s of the country first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>And that is what makes, I think, seeing this kind of thing on a mainstream news outlet so interesting and encouraging.</p>\n<p>To me, I mean, you write for a lot of different publications.</p>\n<p>Do you think that these issues are getting a different or better kind of coverage from the mainstream media than they used to?</p>\n<p>And what effect do you think that that might have in the long run?</p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s starting.</p>\n<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re at least asking some questions now that should have been asked a long time ago about the 85th percentile rule about right on red, which is insane.</p>\n<p>I know you don&rsquo;t have it in New York, but most of the country does.</p>\n<p>And it was introduced in most of the country in the 70s when we had a gas crisis way of saving gas.</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have a gas crisis anymore.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had it for decades.</p>\n<p>We still have right on red in this country.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m playing a role in that process of elevating some of these issues.</p>\n<p>I think media is gradually coming around, but I actually think what&rsquo;s really most encouraging when I look to the future and look to how narratives are shifting, it&rsquo;s not so much how the media is changing.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually what I see among young people.</p>\n<p>You mentioned, Sarah, my role at Harvard over the last several years in the Kennedy School.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to meet a lot of bright, energetic, often, not always, but often progressive 20 something year olds.</p>\n<p>And when I would have like hopefully counted myself among that sort of a cohort, I spent some time in Cambridge myself in my 20s.</p>\n<p>Nobody was really talking about cars.</p>\n<p>Nobody was really talking about transportation.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t cool.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that interesting.</p>\n<p>But now when I go and I give a talk about road safety or mobility as a service, Vision Zero, whatever it is, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are super excited and asking, how can I be a part of this campaign?</p>\n<p>I mean, you see that if you look at like the Reddit fuck cars community, it&rsquo;s what 450,000 people or something insane like that.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s something happening generationally, at least with a subset of younger people that I find really encouraging.</p>\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to eventually permeate media and national discourse in a powerful way.</p>\n<p>David, one of the things I really love about your work is that, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about this issue right now as road safety, but you actually focus a lot of attention on the cars themselves, you know, so it&rsquo;s not just about street design.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the 85th percentile or whatever.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re really focusing on the size of vehicles, the design and engineering of vehicles, the actual products that the auto industry is putting on our streets.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re clearly not setting out to kill people, but their vehicles, their products seem to keep getting more and more dangerous.</p>\n<p>So what is going on with the automobile industry?</p>\n<p>What do you see happening?</p>\n<p>So for this is a long term trend in 1977, 23 percent of new cars in America were SUVs or trucks.</p>\n<p>And now that&rsquo;s over 80 percent.</p>\n<p>Just a stunning shift.</p>\n<p>And in part, this is due to some federal regulations like the cafe loophole that allowed SUVs to be treated as like trucks and there&rsquo;s some other federal rules.</p>\n<p>But a lot of that is due to the car companies trying to figure out how to make more money from a given sale.</p>\n<p>SUVs and trucks are more expensive and more profitable than smaller cars than sedans and station wagons.</p>\n<p>That is a big part of it.</p>\n<p>And I was talking recently with a woman who spent many years as a product developer in one of the big car companies.</p>\n<p>I was asking her, like, how do you actually think about the models that you&rsquo;re designing?</p>\n<p>Because it&rsquo;s not, by the way, just that SUVs and trucks are taking over the car market.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that they themselves are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>\n<p>And what she told me, I thought was really interesting.</p>\n<p>She says, well, look, you know, we all sit down in the beginning of a model refresh process and we ask, you know, like, how do we actually differentiate ourselves from our competitors?</p>\n<p>And the first thing you turn to usually is maybe we provide more legroom, maybe we provide a little more power, maybe we provide a little more trunk space.</p>\n<p>And if that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re starting from, you&rsquo;re naturally going to end up with a bigger, likely heavier vehicle.</p>\n<p>And you just iterate that over 30 years, you can end up with cars becoming much bigger and much heavier than they were, you know, in a prior generation.</p>\n<p>But the problem with these increasing vehicle sizes is not just about having more space in your trunk.</p>\n<p>This has become an arms race on the road where people feel like they need to be in bigger and bigger cars.</p>\n<p>And you actually wrote an article for Slate titled The Road Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy.</p>\n<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you wrote that headline, but it&rsquo;s pretty accurate that these ever larger SUVs that everybody&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;m so safe in my SUV.</p>\n<p>That is the exact thing that&rsquo;s making pedestrian fatality rates go up or contributing to that.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s not just cosmetic, it&rsquo;s life threatening.</p>\n<p>I think that that&rsquo;s the other side of the coin of what this woman who worked in automaker for many years was saying, because she basically was saying effectively, like, nobody really cares about the safety impacts when they&rsquo;re making these decisions.</p>\n<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t put it in those words, but that&rsquo;s the flip side of her point about, you know, trying to figure out ways to get a leg up on the competition, the safety issues for those outside the vehicle just don&rsquo;t factor in.</p>\n<p>And you&rsquo;re right, Sarah, that story that I wrote in Slate, I think, was my attempt to really highlight these gigantic blind spots that emerge as a result, leading to the problems with car bloat.</p>\n<p>But what I was trying to really argue is that we sort of set ourselves up in the United States for this problem that we now have with car bloat because of two problems that have come together now.</p>\n<p>One is that we have always in this country associated road safety with car occupants.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Ralph Nader wrote about in unsafe at any speed.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve always considered road safety to entail is like, how do we keep you safe on the road?</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the basis of our crash test ratings.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what we have set up our entire infrastructure at NHTSA to care about for decades and decades.</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a consumer safety framework, right?</p>\n<p>Consumer is the person who bought the product, bought the car.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the people outside the car.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re not consumers, including, by the way, people in other cars.</p>\n<p>They don&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s you looking out for yourself.</p>\n<p>And then on top of that, Aaron, the second point is that we have a road safety regime that is real, especially in the last 30 years has much to Ralph Nader&rsquo;s frustration sort of moved away from regulation and towards education.</p>\n<p>The idea of informing people with a crash safety rating, how it likes the stars for cars program, or even with like, you know, programs that we probably like, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where we basically say like, who is your designated driver?</p>\n<p>These are ways of sort of encouraging you to do the right thing as opposed to actually regulate.</p>\n<p>So you just sort of let that dynamic play out for a while.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been telling Americans just for decades, you know, look out for protecting yourself inside a vehicle.</p>\n<p>And we&rsquo;re not actually doing anything from a regulation perspective, unlike a lot of other countries to force them as consumers or as car designers to think about the broader safety implications.</p>\n<p>By extension, it&rsquo;s intuitive.</p>\n<p>You end up with a sort of national fleet of cars that&rsquo;s going to be getting bigger and bigger and bigger, because people are looking out for their own self interest, even if overall, we would all prefer to be in a country with smaller cars.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s just not how we&rsquo;re set up to drive.</p>\n<p>Okay, David, I want to push back on something you said a little earlier, and I&rsquo;m doing this in the friendliest way possible.</p>\n<p>You said that you didn&rsquo;t think people in the car industry were evil.</p>\n<p>And I think that&rsquo;s generally true, right?</p>\n<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think anybody comes out of design school, you know, thinking, how can I kill the most people possible, they, they love cars, they think cars are cool, they grew up with like working on their dad&rsquo;s Mustang or something like that.</p>\n<p>But once you are in an industry and you find out that, you know, you&rsquo;re working at the widget factory, and you find out that widgets are the leading killer of children in this country, or that 40,000 people die from using your products every year, what responsibility then do those people have to quit the industry, go find something else to do, change it from within, or be a whistleblower, let&rsquo;s say, you know, I think it relies on an interpretation of evil as like a snidely whiplash sort of character, when in reality, it&rsquo;s more the evil that we&rsquo;re sort of seeing in government overall, right, not just in corporations, but a sort of like going along with the status quo, never questioning it, because there&rsquo;s money to be made.</p>\n<p>I mean, talking about looking out for ourselves, we&rsquo;re doing it in our cars, but we&rsquo;re also doing it in our livelihoods as well, right?</p>\n<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to burn bridges with people that you&rsquo;ve, you know, cultivated in the auto industry, and you are a sharp critic of those people as well, and have gotten into it with them.</p>\n<p>I know some of that, but I think like we have to maybe reframe the idea of like what it means for someone to either be or not be evil, right?</p>\n<p>If I were working in that industry, and I found out that like front over crashes were going up as a result of design that I created, I might reconsider my place in that industry.</p>\n<p>Or you know, we confronted the Dodge folks at the International Auto Show and said, you&rsquo;ve got this awful marketing that is just basically like a middle finger to everybody else who&rsquo;s out on the road, and worse than that, like pointing a gun at everybody else who&rsquo;s out on the road.</p>\n<p>And what responsibility do these marketers have for kind of pulling back?</p>\n<p>Granted, they&rsquo;re not going to, if government&rsquo;s not going to force them to, but I don&rsquo;t know, when I hear like, oh, people aren&rsquo;t evil, I&rsquo;m like, no, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true either, but they&rsquo;re not great actors either.</p>\n<p>Yeah, so I just would caution against painting everybody works at a car company with a broad brush.</p>\n<p>One example I worked on for Slate about Carbloat, I quoted the CTO of Stellantis who said like, it is a huge problem that our cars are getting ever heavier and ever bigger, we need to do something about this as an industry.</p>\n<p>And you know what, I really appreciate that, that sort of like that kind of candor.</p>\n<p>And on the flip side, Doug, and you&rsquo;ve probably seen this, I get pretty pissed off when I see car executives spouting bullshit, which does happen, to be clear.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of a like, I think you should leave hot dog meme of like, we&rsquo;re all trying to find the guy who did this when they said like, yeah, I think this is a huge problem, right?</p>\n<p>Yeah, no, there&rsquo;s that.</p>\n<p>And then you get the people who was just sort of obfuscate and say, oh, bigger SUVs and trucks isn&rsquo;t a source of people dying on roads, it&rsquo;s street lighting, which was something I heard from an executive, you might have seen this was on Twitter, a fight a couple months ago, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>\n<p>And we should call that out as being the baseless stuff that it is.</p>\n<p>But I will say, Doug, and this is maybe where it&rsquo;s weird, I don&rsquo;t normally find myself in the position of defending cars.</p>\n<p>But I think that tobacco, you could argue is a product that really did nobody any good.</p>\n<p>It was just completely like we could have we could get rid of tobacco completely, we&rsquo;d be better off as a society.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate reality of the United States right now is if you just sort of poof, remove all the cars, or you don&rsquo;t create any new cars, a lot of people in New York would be just fine.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d be just fine in Washington DC, I&rsquo;m a bike commuter, I use transit, and I walk a lot.</p>\n<p>But the reality is, we&rsquo;ve built up a country now where most people are going to see a serious decline in their quality of life if they cannot have access to a car.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s a very unfortunate reality, but it&rsquo;s real.</p>\n<p>Yes, I literally just said to someone like the most vexing part of this problem, when people do compare it to cigarettes, is that nobody ever wrote a cigarette to work, right?</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>That made it much easier.</p>\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t absolve the comp, just because people need a means, a personal mobility device, as my co-host Darren would say, to get their groceries, to get their little old lady grandmas to the hospital, to get to work, doesn&rsquo;t mean they need like the child crusher 3000 to do it, right?</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>\n<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that the CEO of Stellantis should be like, I&rsquo;m quitting, and I&rsquo;m going to join the priesthood, and I&rsquo;m getting out of this business altogether.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m saying like, what responsibility do they have to design a better product?</p>\n<p>And that it&rsquo;s just this sort of cognitive disconnect when the guy running the corporation is like, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, like, how are we ever going to change anything?</p>\n<p>I mean, you run the company that does it, my friend, and I understand that you have to answer to shareholders and all of that, but if not you, then who?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s almost like we need the reverse to happen compared to what normally happens.</p>\n<p>Normally people leave government regulation jobs to go work for private industry to help private industry get around government regulations.</p>\n<p>We need these people to like have their come to Jesus moment and leave private industry to get into government regulation, basically.</p>\n<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it happening, Doug, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>\n<p>Like yeah.</p>\n<p>No, of course not.</p>\n<p>I guess this is part of why I&rsquo;m thinking through the questions that you posed and I&rsquo;m struggling a little bit because having talked with so many people in the car industry, I think a lot of them would like to do what you and I would say is the right thing, which is design smaller cars with their backs against the wall in their own minds for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>One is like, you know, Sarah just mentioned it, they are publicly traded companies, so they have to be responsible to their shareholders.</p>\n<p>And relatedly, they are spending a ton of money on R and D right now on electrification and they need that money to come from somewhere.</p>\n<p>And they, by the way, they all just signed these new labor deals.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re going to increase their labor costs.</p>\n<p>So this is the other sort of like tough nut to crack with the car bloat problem is that SUVs and trucks are way more profitable than smaller cars.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually a whole other way of building a car when you are building sedans or smaller cars because you have to build like for quantity as opposed to like having a smaller runs with higher prices and more variation and fun add ons.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s really hard for them to make that kind of a shift.</p>\n<p>In my view, the only way that really happens is not because they have this come to Jesus moral awakening.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I think it&rsquo;s going to happen when regulation forces them to, which is why I talk a lot about state and federal regulations or you have a popular backlash, a broad popular backlash like what happened in the early sixties, partly because of the blow up over Ralph Nader&rsquo;s book, but also because of a whole variety of a number of us Senate investigation hearings, which we&rsquo;ve sort of forgotten about by I believe Ribbinkoff is his name, the senator that were transformative.</p>\n<p>Those are the two directions like grassroots work and popular pressure or federal regulations.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see a sort of like moral reason for automakers to change.</p>\n<p>Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t see it either.</p>\n<p>And I think it gets back to what you were saying earlier, which is that not to offload every bit of responsibility to the younger generations, but they are maybe going to be part of this popular uprising that hopefully changes a little bit of what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I hope so.</p>\n<p>OK, so things are not going to change because somebody has a moral epiphany and wakes up and devotes their life as the former CEO of Stellantis to to changing the world and the way that cars work in it.</p>\n<p>I mean, if things are going to be solved by policy, what kind of policies are out there?</p>\n<p>What kind of policies do you see?</p>\n<p>I know you&rsquo;ve written about the possibility of speed governors.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve written about weight limits.</p>\n<p>You know, where do you see positive policy change happening that&rsquo;s scalable?</p>\n<p>I tell you what I&rsquo;m most excited about are the innovations I see at the state and local level as a growing number of elected leaders and transportation officials just get frustrated with what we&rsquo;re all frustrated here.</p>\n<p>The lack of action from Congress and from NHTSA, right?</p>\n<p>So Sarah, you just alluded to a couple that I think are quite powerful.</p>\n<p>One is in New York City.</p>\n<p>I think it was a really smart move last year to launch a pilot with basically Intelligent Speed Assist, which is sort of like a smart speed limiter that adjusts to the speed limit on 50 vehicles within the city&rsquo;s fleet.</p>\n<p>If the results are strong and they&rsquo;re doing research with the Volpe Center, a major research arm of US DOT, Mayor Adam said he wants to spread it across I think it&rsquo;s 30,000 vehicles in New York City government&rsquo;s fleet that are not emergency response.</p>\n<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m excited about that is because I don&rsquo;t see the US government adopting speed governors anytime soon, as insane as it is that we are able to buy cars that can go 40 miles over a speed limit.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just no one needs to go 120 miles on a public road ever.</p>\n<p>But if you focus on public fleets, they can provide an outsized benefit because not only are those cars going the speed limit or right around the speed limit, they actually slow down everybody behind or they prevent them from slowing them down.</p>\n<p>They prevent them from reckless speeding.</p>\n<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually need every car to have a speed limiter to have a major improvement in street safety.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, that at least is the aspiration.</p>\n<p>So that Sarah is a policy idea fleet based speed regulators I think is potentially really exciting and I&rsquo;ll give New York City credit for being at the tip of the spear on that one.</p>\n<p>So another one that I really like and I&rsquo;m going to take credit for this one because it&rsquo;s my city that went first is weight based car fees.</p>\n<p>Because if NHTSA won&rsquo;t do anything about the car bloat and the risks it creates for everybody else on a street, then that&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>\n<p>But states and cities can potentially find workarounds by playing with their registration fees or even parking fees to make them dramatically scale on the basis of car weight.</p>\n<p>And the District of Columbia where I live adopted weight based car fees that actually had a 7x differential between how much it costs to register like a Hummer, I think it&rsquo;s $500 a year versus a small sedan.</p>\n<p>I wrote a story for CityLab about this, which was a city fights back against heavyweight cars.</p>\n<p>That is the headline I did write Sarah.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re asking about another headline I did not write.</p>\n<p>This one I did.</p>\n<p>And that story went nuclear and it was exciting to see because it showed me just how much enthusiasm there is in the US, far outside of the District of Columbia for tangible ways of pushing back against car bloat.</p>\n<p>So DC now does this, New York has a bill doing it, Colorado has proposed a bill, California is studying it.</p>\n<p>And it strikes me as a very smart way of potentially addressing the car bloat issues that our federal government just seems uninterested in tackling.</p>\n<p>David, we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about cars and car design, but I want to take a detour to Peachtree City, Georgia, which is one of my favorite stories of yours that you went down there and you&rsquo;ve written a lot about micro mobility and, you know, electric scooters and shared bicycles and things like that.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about golf carts for a little bit.</p>\n<p>So Doug, can I tell you a secret about Peachtree City?</p>\n<p>I have a special source there.</p>\n<p>Oh, sure.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s something nobody knows.</p>\n<p>Show with your audience.</p>\n<p>My girlfriend grew up there.</p>\n<p>Well, there you go.</p>\n<p>Oh my God.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>\n<p>So she&rsquo;s been singing the praises of golf carts for a while.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;ve obviously gone down with her and I was just fascinated by it because I don&rsquo;t know about you guys.</p>\n<p>I would guess like before I wrote that story, what is the town that would you guys have golf carts in the US?</p>\n<p>What did you think about?</p>\n<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>\n<p>You think of the villages in Florida.</p>\n<p>Oh, I think of what is called Biscayne Bay.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>\n<p>You mentioned the villages.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s often what people what people say.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard a lot of examples of like of basically like resort towns like Catalina Island and stuff like that and like coastal places.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s so intriguing to me about Peachtree City is that it&rsquo;s neither a sort of like resort area or retirement community.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just an American suburb of, you know, 40 some thousand people with high schools and shopping malls and whatever else.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was really curious to sort of I got, you know, I was already spending time there because that&rsquo;s where my partner&rsquo;s family is from.</p>\n<p>But to actually just like sort of learn about how life revolves around these vehicles.</p>\n<p>And so, yeah, I spent some time down there, Doug, to say like, what&rsquo;s different?</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s really kind of inspiring, actually, to hear the stories about how people&rsquo;s lives have been enhanced.</p>\n<p>You talk to the high schoolers who are like 15 years old and 14 years old and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, now I can go out and see my friends and we can go to the mall or go if we want without a parental chaperone.</p>\n<p>And I feel so much more free.</p>\n<p>And also I feel like I&rsquo;m a better driver in a car when I start doing that because I had the experience with a golf cart and parents don&rsquo;t have to pick up their kids from after school activities in their ninth grade or something because they can get home on their own.</p>\n<p>Or you talk to older people who are retired.</p>\n<p>I talked to one gentleman who had a big operation on his leg.</p>\n<p>I think this I can&rsquo;t remember if this got cut from the story I did for Bloomberg Business Week.</p>\n<p>But he said, like, look, I couldn&rsquo;t fold myself into a car to drive, but I could sit in a golf cart and it helped me like maintain my social connections and get to the store.</p>\n<p>And of course, people are saving a lot of money.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s another issue, too, is like those who have limited incomes.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s great in that way.</p>\n<p>So I think the most inspiring part of that story was just talking to families who said, like, yeah, like, we still drive into Atlanta or we drive to our job at the Atlanta airport because Petri City isn&rsquo;t far from it.</p>\n<p>But when we&rsquo;re at home, you know, we have this network of golf cart pads, which is really the sine qua non of the whole system there.</p>\n<p>And when I&rsquo;m with my family and we&rsquo;re going to go out for a meal or go to a park, we never take a car.</p>\n<p>We always get in the golf cart and it&rsquo;s so much nicer and we get to know our neighbors so much more.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s just so much better.</p>\n<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed that story, Doug.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m glad you said you did.</p>\n<p>I love that story for exactly that reason, because it put mobility as a sort of tool and you&rsquo;re using the right tool for the job.</p>\n<p>So like you said, if they have to go long distances, they break out the SUV fine.</p>\n<p>But for the trip to the grocery store or to see their friends, they&rsquo;re just hopping in this little electric golf cart.</p>\n<p>And when you when you go to a city like Oslo, Norway, and I believe you were there, right, David?</p>\n<p>So you see cars on the street because they&rsquo;re doing a lot to encourage electric cars for better or for worse, but you do see vehicles like the Renault Twizy, which I&rsquo;ve often fantasized about like, man, it would be nice to start a Twizy dealership in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>It basically is a golf cart.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like a very fancy little golf cart.</p>\n<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like kind of looks cooler, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost the same form factor.</p>\n<p>And I mean, is there any way that you can imagine policy where cities are able to encourage and incentivize those kinds of vehicles replacing these big bloated, crappy, dangerous, dirty auto industry products?</p>\n<p>I mean, they could still be auto industry products, just a different kind of product parking spots that are only six feet long.</p>\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting, Doug, because I imagine on street parking might be the best lever we have.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what like what can cities do, David, to like start to discourage big, dirty, dangerous auto industry products and start to replace those products with lighter, cleaner, less expensive, more socially responsible personal mobility devices.</p>\n<p>Skip the subsidies because golf carts like e-cargo bikes are already way cheaper than a new car in America.</p>\n<p>Like it&rsquo;s so unbelievably expensive to buy a new car in this country.</p>\n<p>And instead.</p>\n<p>But what do you mean?</p>\n<p>What do you mean, skip the subsidy?</p>\n<p>Like that&rsquo;s not the place to focus the place to focus.</p>\n<p>If you really want to move the needle on golf cart adoption, in my view, is to build safe places to use them separated from our behemoths of full size cars.</p>\n<p>That could mean golf cart paths, ideally like you have in Peachtree City, but that&rsquo;s not going to be feasible in a big city or even a built out suburb where we&rsquo;d have to a retrofit.</p>\n<p>What you do there is you build a network of slow speed streets that are 25 miles an hour so that the golf cart users can get wherever they want to go, even if they&rsquo;re not using every street, every road in the whole region, they can get wherever they want to go without having to share a lane with an SUV that weighs like three times as much and is traveling three times as fast.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>\n<p>So you think we can&rsquo;t really force change on the auto industry.</p>\n<p>We can&rsquo;t say like, Hey, you guys need to change your products to meet these specifications like lighter, cheaper, cleaner, safer.</p>\n<p>Instead the onus goes on us, the public, the city with our stretched municipal budgets.</p>\n<p>We have to go and transform our city like pour concrete, put up bollards, do all these, like build a whole new transportation infrastructure for the kinds of vehicles we want.</p>\n<p>It feels a little bit like, you know, you&rsquo;re sort of letting private industry off the hook.</p>\n<p>Like you guys go continue to make your bad products.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to go bulletproof our city.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to armor it up and create this separate safe space in the hopes that these other products flourish.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Aaron, I guess I would say that it&rsquo;s the right thing for cities to do regardless is to build safe places to travel that are no vehicles going faster than 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p>Not just to encourage golf guards, but to the people who wanted to, to use a bicycle or an e-bike or a cargo bike, don&rsquo;t have to worry about being clipped and struck and injured or killed by the passing SUV.</p>\n<p>But in what scenario, like we still have cars, we still have these.</p>\n<p>So we&rsquo;re out there on bikes as we are now here in New York city.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s like how we all get around and we&rsquo;re mixing with, you know, 5,000 pound SUVs that can go zero to 60 in four seconds.</p>\n<p>Like why should that product, why should that personal mobility product be allowed to be used in our city?</p>\n<p>Like, and how is it okay to encourage more of us to be biking and being out in golf carts when these incredibly dangerous products are on the street too?</p>\n<p>But couldn&rsquo;t the cities do something that doesn&rsquo;t cost them a lot of money about that?</p>\n<p>For example, we have congestion pricing coming.</p>\n<p>So using DC&rsquo;s example of a weight base beyond parking or registration, let&rsquo;s say, couldn&rsquo;t you say like, okay, the congestion pricing fee is $9.</p>\n<p>But if your car weighs more than 6,000 pounds, it&rsquo;s $50.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>Like there are things that we could do that aren&rsquo;t going to cost the city money and ultimately will be cheaper for preventing the death and destruction and infrastructure damage that these larger cars are doing.</p>\n<p>And I think you can do that with parking too.</p>\n<p>You could be like if you want to park a behemoth on the, you know, the on-street.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s $2 an hour for everybody except for you in your behemoth.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s $17.</p>\n<p>But David, it just, I just feel like so I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize you because I feel like this is the, the set of policy proposal, you know, we sometimes have called ourselves a livable streets movement.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been very focused on streets.</p>\n<p>It just feels to me after 20 years of this, like it&rsquo;s not working that well.</p>\n<p>Like, like I don&rsquo;t feel safer on the street on my bike.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not super comfortable with my kids biking still.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t really focus on the cars and the car industry products and they keep getting more dangerous.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I really want a set of policies that does something about that.</p>\n<p>So give it to me.</p>\n<p>Give it to me, David.</p>\n<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no single policy that&rsquo;s going to fix this sort of like deep hole we&rsquo;ve dug ourselves into with, with ubiquitous cars that are often too big and too powerful and too dangerous in this country.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of biting off little pieces of the puzzle and those solutions are going to be partial.</p>\n<p>And they&rsquo;re also going to depend on the environment in which we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\n<p>Like Peachtree city is a wonderful example that could be emulated by new suburbs that are being built from scratch and master developed.</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s say like the excerpts of Phoenix or Orlando or something like that.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know that Peachtree city has a lot to tell us about what to do in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very different.</p>\n<p>To be totally honest.</p>\n<p>But I think what Aaron is saying is, you know, we were talking about Ralph Nader earlier and you know, the impact that his work had on road safety was just so tremendous.</p>\n<p>So outscale.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t little nibbles here and there, right?</p>\n<p>Because we got seat belts, we got airbags, we got like saved thousands of lives.</p>\n<p>And we did that by sitting down in front of the United States Congress and making it crystal clear to the members of Congress and also to the American public that there was a product safety problem that was at least in part motivated by corporate greed, right?</p>\n<p>And unwillingness to put the money in to do these safety improvements without being forced.</p>\n<p>And I guess, I mean, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this.</p>\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like we need a Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s David.</p>\n<p>And I always thought it was David.</p>\n<p>I actually do think I would sometimes read your stuff and I&rsquo;m like, oh, David could be the Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s like what, you know.</p>\n<p>So have you been invited to testify in front of Congress?</p>\n<p>Are you going to run for president in 2024?</p>\n<p>Is there some scenario in which you could see yourself testifying in front of a committee, you know, you or somebody else and really just opening people&rsquo;s eyes to these, these products are unsafe at any speed?</p>\n<p>At any size.</p>\n<p>At any size, right?</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>I mean, Nader&rsquo;s book was transformative for thinking about product safety of cars, right?</p>\n<p>And how cars were endangering people inside of them.</p>\n<p>Although I will add one thing, Sarah, to the little history you shared there.</p>\n<p>When Nader&rsquo;s book first came out unsafe at any speed, it was not immediately a hit.</p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to keep this in mind.</p>\n<p>It was like, you know, some people read it.</p>\n<p>It was okay.</p>\n<p>It was fine.</p>\n<p>You know what turned it into the sort of like breakthrough bestseller transformative book that we know of it?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s because General Motors hired detectives to sort of clumsily look for dirt in Nader&rsquo;s background, like trying to like hook him up with prostitutes or whatever, got nowhere.</p>\n<p>And then this, then this news got out.</p>\n<p>And when that happened, you guys know this story?</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t know this story?</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>I knew that they tried to dig up dirt on him.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n<p>They found nothing.</p>\n<p>They found nothing.</p>\n<p>Like Nader is like squeaky clean.</p>\n<p>The news of this investigation got out.</p>\n<p>And now you have, I think the technical term is a shit show.</p>\n<p>And GM, this is actually a really fascinating moment in American history.</p>\n<p>GM backpedaled.</p>\n<p>It was just one of the biggest corporate cell phones in American history, I would say.</p>\n<p>And General Motors did a big payout to Nader, who then used that money not to buy himself a new house, but to actually fund these consumer advocacy organizations that basically made him a national here.</p>\n<p>So I just, so I, first of all, I just think the story is fascinating is why I bring it up.</p>\n<p>But also I just want to be clear, it wasn&rsquo;t simply like Nader published the book and everything changed.</p>\n<p>Nader published a book.</p>\n<p>It did okay.</p>\n<p>It built on some momentum is already coming along.</p>\n<p>And then General Motors just shot itself in the foot in the biggest way possible.</p>\n<p>So David, you need to write a book, Stellantis needs to like see if you&rsquo;ve got any skeletons in your closet and then you&rsquo;ll ride that Streisand effect to banning SUVs.</p>\n<p>Done.</p>\n<p>Problem solved.</p>\n<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>No, but there&rsquo;s a broader point you were making, which I didn&rsquo;t address yet, which was like, how do you actually get the policymakers to care?</p>\n<p>I mean, I live in DC. I&rsquo;ve actually spoken with congressmen and representatives and people in power about this.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, I was talking with Earl Blumenauer.</p>\n<p>You guys may know him.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s about to retire.</p>\n<p>Adam on the pod.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s a guest on the podcast.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>\n<p>Friend of the podcast.</p>\n<p>Great guy.</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n<p>Like a hero for people like biking in particular.</p>\n<p>I asked him like, what&rsquo;s the deal with car bloat and with cars?</p>\n<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>\n<p>Is there any interest among your colleagues to do something?</p>\n<p>And he basically was like, they&rsquo;re scared shitless of doing anything like that.</p>\n<p>Even if they know it&rsquo;s a problem, because there&rsquo;s this this conflation of cars and freedom in the American mind, which automakers have really built up with all their ads and so forth and so on.</p>\n<p>And he was very candid with me sort of saying, like, look, there&rsquo;s got to be a public push to force us to do something.</p>\n<p>And this is a guy who wants to do something like there has to be a ground solo support.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, just to bring it full circle, look, like you were saying nice things about me.</p>\n<p>And I appreciate that, but I&rsquo;ll say, like, look, I think you guys and podcasts like yours play an important role, because even if you are like a lot of people you&rsquo;re reaching, I think are already on the team.</p>\n<p>Not everyone.</p>\n<p>I think there&rsquo;s some who learn about the problems with cars through it.</p>\n<p>But you really need deeper, stronger, broader organizations like this to sort of create the cover for elected leaders to make the decisions that they&rsquo;re just not making right now in Congress and also in a lot of state governments.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good place to wrap it up.</p>\n<p>Yeah, David, we really appreciate, you know, your output.</p>\n<p>I think, you know, you&rsquo;re writing so many of these and every now and then something breaks through to Dallas local TV news.</p>\n<p>So we really, we really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Your pen is a sword.</p>\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n<p>In the war on cars.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>\n<p>We just need to build a much, much bigger team.</p>\n<p>And you&rsquo;re a great part of that.</p>\n<p>So thank you so much for coming on the war on cars.</p>\n<p>No, it&rsquo;s my pleasure to be with you.</p>\n<p>I mentioned a few of my articles and if people are listening or curious to find them, they&rsquo;re all available on my website, which is davidzipper.com.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Thanks to Mammoth&rsquo;s onboarding process, of all gosh darned referrers.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Considering he was already a member of my sadly-destined-for-oblivion-at-any-moment, quite prolific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439\" title=\"David Blue's Auto Twitter List\">automotive Twitter list</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

I'd never actually been to Dallas.\n\nI made very clear to them, I know nothing about your specific city, but I'm happy to help if I can because I frankly never seen a really good video investigation in American News into American road safety that reaches a broad audience.\n\nAnd they eventually flew me out and they drove, it was kind of funny, they drove me around Dallas and would bring me these like terrible roads like Buckner Avenue.\n\nIf anyone knows Dallas in the east, it's in a lower income, largely Latino neighborhood.\n\nThey're like, you know, it's just like the classic strode where you've got a bus stop across the strode and people are like running across it because the nearest crosswalk is a half mile away.\n\nAnd they'd be like, well, what do you think of this?\n\nI'd say it's terrible.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nOf course, it's terrible.\n\nThis is designed for danger.\n\nAnd I didn't know what was going to come from it.\n\nAnd it was a few weeks later that I saw the series that they put together, which I was so impressed by because they included not just a few snippets from myself.\n\nI mean, I'm just one of a bunch of people they included.\n\nThey went all the way to Edmonton, Canada, to look at how road safety could be done much better with sort of bulb outs and with much better leading pedestrian indicators and things like that.\n\nAnd they also cornered the head of TxDOT and sort of grilled him about the 85th percentile rule and how he was using that or his agency uses that to set speed limits too high.\n\nThat to me was like such a great moment to see that style of journalism deployed that way.\n\nBut maybe you could also explain what the 85th percentile rule is and why it's such a messed up way to set speed limits.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo the 85th percentile rule actually was like developed as a concept in the thirties.\n\nAnd the idea there was to figure out how to set speed limits in rural areas, but it just sort of got stuck.\n\nIt ended up being plastered all over sort of state DOT policy rules for cities too.\n\nAnd that's been a huge problem.\n\nWhat the 85th percentile rule is to basically say, it's pretty simple.\n\nIt's like, just go to a given street, record 100 speeds of drivers, and then it doesn't matter how many crazies you have that are blowing past that street far faster than is safe for anybody not inside a vehicle, regardless, you just basically pick the 85th person out of a hundred and they set the speed limit for the entire street.\n\nAnd that ends up basically making it very difficult to lower speed limits to speeds that are safer for particularly the road users or street users who are outside the vehicle.\n\nThat's what it is.\n\nAnd the reporter confronted the head of tech dot on this.\n\nCan you describe maybe a little bit of what happened there?\n\nSure.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I myself wasn't there for this, but I did, I was asked about it in the studio and I said, I don't really understand how tech dot says they want to build safe streets, but they're literally lifting the speed limit and some major roads and highways in Dallas, which invariably will make those streets more and roads more dangerous.\n\nAnd the reporters in friend BC had concluded speed was going to be sort of like the main topic or the main sort of like pillar of their argument for why Dallas streets are so dangerous.\n\nAnd they wanted to talk to the tech dot director, tech stop being in the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nAnd he kept avoiding them.\n\nThe press office was just like putting up a wall.\n\nSo eventually the reporters just went ahead to a public meeting where text that was going to be speaking and they just confronted the director and they forced him to talk to him.\n\nAnd they asked him about the 85th percentile and said, oh, we're moving away from that.\n\nWe're not using that so much anymore.\n\nAnd then the reporters to their credit investigated a bit and found text documents that clearly were using the 85th percentile to set the speed limit in Dallas.\n\nSo it was a bit of a gotcha moment that frankly, I enjoyed going to a hospital and asking them why they're still using leeches.\n\nLike it's this thing that was set in the 1930s.\n\nAnd I think very similar to our Donald Shoop episode where he talks about minimum parking requirements of just like this thing that was set and nobody's ever really questioned.\n\nAnd it's a sort of pseudoscience that still guides the design of our cities.\n\nIt's even crazier than leeches because it's like the drivers are doing something illegal and dangerous.\n\nThey're speeding and we're basically saying like, okay, you guys who are doing something illegal and dangerous get to sort of determine you set the pace, you set the pace, like we're going to base the whole system on the 85th percentile of this illegal thing you're doing.\n\nIt's just so nonsensical.\n\nBut David, I'm so glad that you were on that piece because sort of like you were saying, a lot of news, especially local news will focus on like crazy drivers and Dallas being as bad as it is, worse than Houston, worse than Phoenix, worse than Los Angeles in terms of road fatalities.\n\nDoes Dallas really have crazier drivers than Phoenix?\n\nDoes Dallas really have crazier drivers than Houston in the same state?\n\nSeems unlikely.\n\nWhat they have are worse roads.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd frankly, Dallas, I would argue probably has marginally worse roads than some of those other places.\n\nLike Las Vegas is incredibly dangerous too.\n\nSo is Phoenix, so is Houston.\n\nIt's not like they've solved the problem there.\n\nBut for me, part of the reason why I was happy to spend a couple days in Texas with the reporters and be part of the story, and I didn't know what it was going to turn into.\n\nIt turned out frankly, like far more powerful and better than I expected.\n\nI was happy to do it because I have the privilege of living in Washington, DC, which is a very expensive city.\n\nNot coincidentally, it's one of the handful of places in the US like New York, where walking and biking as a main mode of transportation along with transit really is possible.\n\nMost of this country is more like Dallas.\n\nAnd I try to always hold myself accountable and try to remember that most of the United States doesn't look like the city where I live.\n\nAnd if we really want to address the road safety problems that we have and solve our transportation issues, frankly, we have to think about the Dallas's of the country first and foremost.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd that is what makes, I think, seeing this kind of thing on a mainstream news outlet so interesting and encouraging.\n\nTo me, I mean, you write for a lot of different publications.\n\nDo you think that these issues are getting a different or better kind of coverage from the mainstream media than they used to?\n\nAnd what effect do you think that that might have in the long run?\n\nI think it's starting.\n\nLike I think it's we're at least asking some questions now that should have been asked a long time ago about the 85th percentile rule about right on red, which is insane.\n\nI know you don't have it in New York, but most of the country does.\n\nAnd it was introduced in most of the country in the 70s when we had a gas crisis way of saving gas.\n\nWe don't have a gas crisis anymore.\n\nI've had it for decades.\n\nWe still have right on red in this country.\n\nI'd like to think that I'm playing a role in that process of elevating some of these issues.\n\nI think media is gradually coming around, but I actually think what's really most encouraging when I look to the future and look to how narratives are shifting, it's not so much how the media is changing.\n\nIt's actually what I see among young people.\n\nYou mentioned, Sarah, my role at Harvard over the last several years in the Kennedy School.\n\nI've gotten to meet a lot of bright, energetic, often, not always, but often progressive 20 something year olds.\n\nAnd when I would have like hopefully counted myself among that sort of a cohort, I spent some time in Cambridge myself in my 20s.\n\nNobody was really talking about cars.\n\nNobody was really talking about transportation.\n\nIt wasn't cool.\n\nIt wasn't that interesting.\n\nBut now when I go and I give a talk about road safety or mobility as a service, Vision Zero, whatever it is, you know, there's a lot of people who are super excited and asking, how can I be a part of this campaign?\n\nI mean, you see that if you look at like the Reddit fuck cars community, it's what 450,000 people or something insane like that.\n\nIt's I think there's something happening generationally, at least with a subset of younger people that I find really encouraging.\n\nI think that's going to eventually permeate media and national discourse in a powerful way.\n\nDavid, one of the things I really love about your work is that, you know, we're talking about this issue right now as road safety, but you actually focus a lot of attention on the cars themselves, you know, so it's not just about street design.\n\nIt's not just about the 85th percentile or whatever.\n\nYou're really focusing on the size of vehicles, the design and engineering of vehicles, the actual products that the auto industry is putting on our streets.\n\nThey're clearly not setting out to kill people, but their vehicles, their products seem to keep getting more and more dangerous.\n\nSo what is going on with the automobile industry?\n\nWhat do you see happening?\n\nSo for this is a long term trend in 1977, 23 percent of new cars in America were SUVs or trucks.\n\nAnd now that's over 80 percent.\n\nJust a stunning shift.\n\nAnd in part, this is due to some federal regulations like the cafe loophole that allowed SUVs to be treated as like trucks and there's some other federal rules.\n\nBut a lot of that is due to the car companies trying to figure out how to make more money from a given sale.\n\nSUVs and trucks are more expensive and more profitable than smaller cars than sedans and station wagons.\n\nThat is a big part of it.\n\nAnd I was talking recently with a woman who spent many years as a product developer in one of the big car companies.\n\nI was asking her, like, how do you actually think about the models that you're designing?\n\nBecause it's not, by the way, just that SUVs and trucks are taking over the car market.\n\nIt's that they themselves are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\nAnd what she told me, I thought was really interesting.\n\nShe says, well, look, you know, we all sit down in the beginning of a model refresh process and we ask, you know, like, how do we actually differentiate ourselves from our competitors?\n\nAnd the first thing you turn to usually is maybe we provide more legroom, maybe we provide a little more power, maybe we provide a little more trunk space.\n\nAnd if that's where you're starting from, you're naturally going to end up with a bigger, likely heavier vehicle.\n\nAnd you just iterate that over 30 years, you can end up with cars becoming much bigger and much heavier than they were, you know, in a prior generation.\n\nBut the problem with these increasing vehicle sizes is not just about having more space in your trunk.\n\nThis has become an arms race on the road where people feel like they need to be in bigger and bigger cars.\n\nAnd you actually wrote an article for Slate titled The Road Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy.\n\nNow, I don't know if you wrote that headline, but it's pretty accurate that these ever larger SUVs that everybody's like, oh, I'm so safe in my SUV.\n\nThat is the exact thing that's making pedestrian fatality rates go up or contributing to that.\n\nSo it's not just cosmetic, it's life threatening.\n\nI think that that's the other side of the coin of what this woman who worked in automaker for many years was saying, because she basically was saying effectively, like, nobody really cares about the safety impacts when they're making these decisions.\n\nWe shouldn't put it in those words, but that's the flip side of her point about, you know, trying to figure out ways to get a leg up on the competition, the safety issues for those outside the vehicle just don't factor in.\n\nAnd you're right, Sarah, that story that I wrote in Slate, I think, was my attempt to really highlight these gigantic blind spots that emerge as a result, leading to the problems with car bloat.\n\nBut what I was trying to really argue is that we sort of set ourselves up in the United States for this problem that we now have with car bloat because of two problems that have come together now.\n\nOne is that we have always in this country associated road safety with car occupants.\n\nThat's what Ralph Nader wrote about in unsafe at any speed.\n\nAnd that's what we've always considered road safety to entail is like, how do we keep you safe on the road?\n\nThat's the basis of our crash test ratings.\n\nThat's what we have set up our entire infrastructure at NHTSA to care about for decades and decades.\n\nRight.\n\nIt's a consumer safety framework, right?\n\nConsumer is the person who bought the product, bought the car.\n\nIt's not the people outside the car.\n\nThey're not consumers, including, by the way, people in other cars.\n\nThey don't matter.\n\nIt's you looking out for yourself.\n\nAnd then on top of that, Aaron, the second point is that we have a road safety regime that is real, especially in the last 30 years has much to Ralph Nader's frustration sort of moved away from regulation and towards education.\n\nThe idea of informing people with a crash safety rating, how it likes the stars for cars program, or even with like, you know, programs that we probably like, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where we basically say like, who is your designated driver?\n\nThese are ways of sort of encouraging you to do the right thing as opposed to actually regulate.\n\nSo you just sort of let that dynamic play out for a while.\n\nWe've been telling Americans just for decades, you know, look out for protecting yourself inside a vehicle.\n\nAnd we're not actually doing anything from a regulation perspective, unlike a lot of other countries to force them as consumers or as car designers to think about the broader safety implications.\n\nBy extension, it's intuitive.\n\nYou end up with a sort of national fleet of cars that's going to be getting bigger and bigger and bigger, because people are looking out for their own self interest, even if overall, we would all prefer to be in a country with smaller cars.\n\nThat's just not how we're set up to drive.\n\nOkay, David, I want to push back on something you said a little earlier, and I'm doing this in the friendliest way possible.\n\nYou said that you didn't think people in the car industry were evil.\n\nAnd I think that's generally true, right?\n\nLike, I don't think anybody comes out of design school, you know, thinking, how can I kill the most people possible, they, they love cars, they think cars are cool, they grew up with like working on their dad's Mustang or something like that.\n\nBut once you are in an industry and you find out that, you know, you're working at the widget factory, and you find out that widgets are the leading killer of children in this country, or that 40,000 people die from using your products every year, what responsibility then do those people have to quit the industry, go find something else to do, change it from within, or be a whistleblower, let's say, you know, I think it relies on an interpretation of evil as like a snidely whiplash sort of character, when in reality, it's more the evil that we're sort of seeing in government overall, right, not just in corporations, but a sort of like going along with the status quo, never questioning it, because there's money to be made.\n\nI mean, talking about looking out for ourselves, we're doing it in our cars, but we're also doing it in our livelihoods as well, right?\n\nI know you don't want to burn bridges with people that you've, you know, cultivated in the auto industry, and you are a sharp critic of those people as well, and have gotten into it with them.\n\nI know some of that, but I think like we have to maybe reframe the idea of like what it means for someone to either be or not be evil, right?\n\nIf I were working in that industry, and I found out that like front over crashes were going up as a result of design that I created, I might reconsider my place in that industry.\n\nOr you know, we confronted the Dodge folks at the International Auto Show and said, you've got this awful marketing that is just basically like a middle finger to everybody else who's out on the road, and worse than that, like pointing a gun at everybody else who's out on the road.\n\nAnd what responsibility do these marketers have for kind of pulling back?\n\nGranted, they're not going to, if government's not going to force them to, but I don't know, when I hear like, oh, people aren't evil, I'm like, no, I don't think that's true either, but they're not great actors either.\n\nYeah, so I just would caution against painting everybody works at a car company with a broad brush.\n\nOne example I worked on for Slate about Carbloat, I quoted the CTO of Stellantis who said like, it is a huge problem that our cars are getting ever heavier and ever bigger, we need to do something about this as an industry.\n\nAnd you know what, I really appreciate that, that sort of like that kind of candor.\n\nAnd on the flip side, Doug, and you've probably seen this, I get pretty pissed off when I see car executives spouting bullshit, which does happen, to be clear.\n\nThere's a little bit of a like, I think you should leave hot dog meme of like, we're all trying to find the guy who did this when they said like, yeah, I think this is a huge problem, right?\n\nYeah, no, there's that.\n\nAnd then you get the people who was just sort of obfuscate and say, oh, bigger SUVs and trucks isn't a source of people dying on roads, it's street lighting, which was something I heard from an executive, you might have seen this was on Twitter, a fight a couple months ago, that's ridiculous.\n\nAnd we should call that out as being the baseless stuff that it is.\n\nBut I will say, Doug, and this is maybe where it's weird, I don't normally find myself in the position of defending cars.\n\nBut I think that tobacco, you could argue is a product that really did nobody any good.\n\nIt was just completely like we could have we could get rid of tobacco completely, we'd be better off as a society.\n\nThe unfortunate reality of the United States right now is if you just sort of poof, remove all the cars, or you don't create any new cars, a lot of people in New York would be just fine.\n\nI'd be just fine in Washington DC, I'm a bike commuter, I use transit, and I walk a lot.\n\nBut the reality is, we've built up a country now where most people are going to see a serious decline in their quality of life if they cannot have access to a car.\n\nAnd that's a very unfortunate reality, but it's real.\n\nYes, I literally just said to someone like the most vexing part of this problem, when people do compare it to cigarettes, is that nobody ever wrote a cigarette to work, right?\n\nExactly.\n\nThat made it much easier.\n\nBut that doesn't absolve the comp, just because people need a means, a personal mobility device, as my co-host Darren would say, to get their groceries, to get their little old lady grandmas to the hospital, to get to work, doesn't mean they need like the child crusher 3000 to do it, right?\n\nThat's right.\n\nSo I'm not saying that the CEO of Stellantis should be like, I'm quitting, and I'm going to join the priesthood, and I'm getting out of this business altogether.\n\nI'm saying like, what responsibility do they have to design a better product?\n\nAnd that it's just this sort of cognitive disconnect when the guy running the corporation is like, yeah, I don't know, like, how are we ever going to change anything?\n\nI mean, you run the company that does it, my friend, and I understand that you have to answer to shareholders and all of that, but if not you, then who?\n\nIt's almost like we need the reverse to happen compared to what normally happens.\n\nNormally people leave government regulation jobs to go work for private industry to help private industry get around government regulations.\n\nWe need these people to like have their come to Jesus moment and leave private industry to get into government regulation, basically.\n\nI just don't see it happening, Doug, I'll be honest with you.\n\nLike yeah.\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nI guess this is part of why I'm thinking through the questions that you posed and I'm struggling a little bit because having talked with so many people in the car industry, I think a lot of them would like to do what you and I would say is the right thing, which is design smaller cars with their backs against the wall in their own minds for a few reasons.\n\nOne is like, you know, Sarah just mentioned it, they are publicly traded companies, so they have to be responsible to their shareholders.\n\nAnd relatedly, they are spending a ton of money on R and D right now on electrification and they need that money to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd they, by the way, they all just signed these new labor deals.\n\nThey're going to increase their labor costs.\n\nSo this is the other sort of like tough nut to crack with the car bloat problem is that SUVs and trucks are way more profitable than smaller cars.\n\nIt's actually a whole other way of building a car when you are building sedans or smaller cars because you have to build like for quantity as opposed to like having a smaller runs with higher prices and more variation and fun add ons.\n\nIt's really hard for them to make that kind of a shift.\n\nIn my view, the only way that really happens is not because they have this come to Jesus moral awakening.\n\nIt's not going to happen.\n\nI don't think I think it's going to happen when regulation forces them to, which is why I talk a lot about state and federal regulations or you have a popular backlash, a broad popular backlash like what happened in the early sixties, partly because of the blow up over Ralph Nader's book, but also because of a whole variety of a number of us Senate investigation hearings, which we've sort of forgotten about by I believe Ribbinkoff is his name, the senator that were transformative.\n\nThose are the two directions like grassroots work and popular pressure or federal regulations.\n\nI don't see a sort of like moral reason for automakers to change.\n\nOh, no, I don't see it either.\n\nAnd I think it gets back to what you were saying earlier, which is that not to offload every bit of responsibility to the younger generations, but they are maybe going to be part of this popular uprising that hopefully changes a little bit of what we're talking about.\n\nYeah, I hope so.\n\nOK, so things are not going to change because somebody has a moral epiphany and wakes up and devotes their life as the former CEO of Stellantis to to changing the world and the way that cars work in it.\n\nI mean, if things are going to be solved by policy, what kind of policies are out there?\n\nWhat kind of policies do you see?\n\nI know you've written about the possibility of speed governors.\n\nYou've written about weight limits.\n\nYou know, where do you see positive policy change happening that's scalable?\n\nI tell you what I'm most excited about are the innovations I see at the state and local level as a growing number of elected leaders and transportation officials just get frustrated with what we're all frustrated here.\n\nThe lack of action from Congress and from NHTSA, right?\n\nSo Sarah, you just alluded to a couple that I think are quite powerful.\n\nOne is in New York City.\n\nI think it was a really smart move last year to launch a pilot with basically Intelligent Speed Assist, which is sort of like a smart speed limiter that adjusts to the speed limit on 50 vehicles within the city's fleet.\n\nIf the results are strong and they're doing research with the Volpe Center, a major research arm of US DOT, Mayor Adam said he wants to spread it across I think it's 30,000 vehicles in New York City government's fleet that are not emergency response.\n\nAnd the reason why I'm excited about that is because I don't see the US government adopting speed governors anytime soon, as insane as it is that we are able to buy cars that can go 40 miles over a speed limit.\n\nIt's just no one needs to go 120 miles on a public road ever.\n\nBut if you focus on public fleets, they can provide an outsized benefit because not only are those cars going the speed limit or right around the speed limit, they actually slow down everybody behind or they prevent them from slowing them down.\n\nThey prevent them from reckless speeding.\n\nSo you don't actually need every car to have a speed limiter to have a major improvement in street safety.\n\nHopefully, that at least is the aspiration.\n\nSo that Sarah is a policy idea fleet based speed regulators I think is potentially really exciting and I'll give New York City credit for being at the tip of the spear on that one.\n\nSo another one that I really like and I'm going to take credit for this one because it's my city that went first is weight based car fees.\n\nBecause if NHTSA won't do anything about the car bloat and the risks it creates for everybody else on a street, then that's a challenge.\n\nBut states and cities can potentially find workarounds by playing with their registration fees or even parking fees to make them dramatically scale on the basis of car weight.\n\nAnd the District of Columbia where I live adopted weight based car fees that actually had a 7x differential between how much it costs to register like a Hummer, I think it's $500 a year versus a small sedan.\n\nI wrote a story for CityLab about this, which was a city fights back against heavyweight cars.\n\nThat is the headline I did write Sarah.\n\nYou're asking about another headline I did not write.\n\nThis one I did.\n\nAnd that story went nuclear and it was exciting to see because it showed me just how much enthusiasm there is in the US, far outside of the District of Columbia for tangible ways of pushing back against car bloat.\n\nSo DC now does this, New York has a bill doing it, Colorado has proposed a bill, California is studying it.\n\nAnd it strikes me as a very smart way of potentially addressing the car bloat issues that our federal government just seems uninterested in tackling.\n\nDavid, we've been talking a lot about cars and car design, but I want to take a detour to Peachtree City, Georgia, which is one of my favorite stories of yours that you went down there and you've written a lot about micro mobility and, you know, electric scooters and shared bicycles and things like that.\n\nLet's talk about golf carts for a little bit.\n\nSo Doug, can I tell you a secret about Peachtree City?\n\nI have a special source there.\n\nOh, sure.\n\nHere's something nobody knows.\n\nShow with your audience.\n\nMy girlfriend grew up there.\n\nWell, there you go.\n\nOh my God.\n\nThat's so cool.\n\nSo she's been singing the praises of golf carts for a while.\n\nAnd I've obviously gone down with her and I was just fascinated by it because I don't know about you guys.\n\nI would guess like before I wrote that story, what is the town that would you guys have golf carts in the US?\n\nWhat did you think about?\n\nFirst of all, I'm just curious.\n\nYou think of the villages in Florida.\n\nOh, I think of what is called Biscayne Bay.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nIt's interesting.\n\nYou mentioned the villages.\n\nThat's often what people what people say.\n\nI've also heard a lot of examples of like of basically like resort towns like Catalina Island and stuff like that and like coastal places.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat's so intriguing to me about Peachtree City is that it's neither a sort of like resort area or retirement community.\n\nIt's just an American suburb of, you know, 40 some thousand people with high schools and shopping malls and whatever else.\n\nAnd that's why I was really curious to sort of I got, you know, I was already spending time there because that's where my partner's family is from.\n\nBut to actually just like sort of learn about how life revolves around these vehicles.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I spent some time down there, Doug, to say like, what's different?\n\nAnd it's really kind of inspiring, actually, to hear the stories about how people's lives have been enhanced.\n\nYou talk to the high schoolers who are like 15 years old and 14 years old and they're like, yeah, now I can go out and see my friends and we can go to the mall or go if we want without a parental chaperone.\n\nAnd I feel so much more free.\n\nAnd also I feel like I'm a better driver in a car when I start doing that because I had the experience with a golf cart and parents don't have to pick up their kids from after school activities in their ninth grade or something because they can get home on their own.\n\nOr you talk to older people who are retired.\n\nI talked to one gentleman who had a big operation on his leg.\n\nI think this I can't remember if this got cut from the story I did for Bloomberg Business Week.\n\nBut he said, like, look, I couldn't fold myself into a car to drive, but I could sit in a golf cart and it helped me like maintain my social connections and get to the store.\n\nAnd of course, people are saving a lot of money.\n\nThat's another issue, too, is like those who have limited incomes.\n\nIt's great in that way.\n\nSo I think the most inspiring part of that story was just talking to families who said, like, yeah, like, we still drive into Atlanta or we drive to our job at the Atlanta airport because Petri City isn't far from it.\n\nBut when we're at home, you know, we have this network of golf cart pads, which is really the sine qua non of the whole system there.\n\nAnd when I'm with my family and we're going to go out for a meal or go to a park, we never take a car.\n\nWe always get in the golf cart and it's so much nicer and we get to know our neighbors so much more.\n\nAnd it's just so much better.\n\nSo I don't know.\n\nI hope you enjoyed that story, Doug.\n\nI'm glad you said you did.\n\nI love that story for exactly that reason, because it put mobility as a sort of tool and you're using the right tool for the job.\n\nSo like you said, if they have to go long distances, they break out the SUV fine.\n\nBut for the trip to the grocery store or to see their friends, they're just hopping in this little electric golf cart.\n\nAnd when you when you go to a city like Oslo, Norway, and I believe you were there, right, David?\n\nSo you see cars on the street because they're doing a lot to encourage electric cars for better or for worse, but you do see vehicles like the Renault Twizy, which I've often fantasized about like, man, it would be nice to start a Twizy dealership in Manhattan.\n\nIt basically is a golf cart.\n\nIt's like a very fancy little golf cart.\n\nYou know, it's like kind of looks cooler, but it's it's almost the same form factor.\n\nAnd I mean, is there any way that you can imagine policy where cities are able to encourage and incentivize those kinds of vehicles replacing these big bloated, crappy, dangerous, dirty auto industry products?\n\nI mean, they could still be auto industry products, just a different kind of product parking spots that are only six feet long.\n\nWell, that's interesting, Doug, because I imagine on street parking might be the best lever we have.\n\nI don't know what like what can cities do, David, to like start to discourage big, dirty, dangerous auto industry products and start to replace those products with lighter, cleaner, less expensive, more socially responsible personal mobility devices.\n\nSkip the subsidies because golf carts like e-cargo bikes are already way cheaper than a new car in America.\n\nLike it's so unbelievably expensive to buy a new car in this country.\n\nAnd instead.\n\nBut what do you mean?\n\nWhat do you mean, skip the subsidy?\n\nLike that's not the place to focus the place to focus.\n\nIf you really want to move the needle on golf cart adoption, in my view, is to build safe places to use them separated from our behemoths of full size cars.\n\nThat could mean golf cart paths, ideally like you have in Peachtree City, but that's not going to be feasible in a big city or even a built out suburb where we'd have to a retrofit.\n\nWhat you do there is you build a network of slow speed streets that are 25 miles an hour so that the golf cart users can get wherever they want to go, even if they're not using every street, every road in the whole region, they can get wherever they want to go without having to share a lane with an SUV that weighs like three times as much and is traveling three times as fast.\n\nThat's what we need to do.\n\nSo you think we can't really force change on the auto industry.\n\nWe can't say like, Hey, you guys need to change your products to meet these specifications like lighter, cheaper, cleaner, safer.\n\nInstead the onus goes on us, the public, the city with our stretched municipal budgets.\n\nWe have to go and transform our city like pour concrete, put up bollards, do all these, like build a whole new transportation infrastructure for the kinds of vehicles we want.\n\nIt feels a little bit like, you know, you're sort of letting private industry off the hook.\n\nLike you guys go continue to make your bad products.\n\nWe're going to go bulletproof our city.\n\nWe're going to armor it up and create this separate safe space in the hopes that these other products flourish.\n\nI don't know, Aaron, I guess I would say that it's the right thing for cities to do regardless is to build safe places to travel that are no vehicles going faster than 25 miles per hour.\n\nNot just to encourage golf guards, but to the people who wanted to, to use a bicycle or an e-bike or a cargo bike, don't have to worry about being clipped and struck and injured or killed by the passing SUV.\n\nBut in what scenario, like we still have cars, we still have these.\n\nSo we're out there on bikes as we are now here in New York city.\n\nAnd it's like how we all get around and we're mixing with, you know, 5,000 pound SUVs that can go zero to 60 in four seconds.\n\nLike why should that product, why should that personal mobility product be allowed to be used in our city?\n\nLike, and how is it okay to encourage more of us to be biking and being out in golf carts when these incredibly dangerous products are on the street too?\n\nBut couldn't the cities do something that doesn't cost them a lot of money about that?\n\nFor example, we have congestion pricing coming.\n\nSo using DC's example of a weight base beyond parking or registration, let's say, couldn't you say like, okay, the congestion pricing fee is $9.\n\nBut if your car weighs more than 6,000 pounds, it's $50.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike there are things that we could do that aren't going to cost the city money and ultimately will be cheaper for preventing the death and destruction and infrastructure damage that these larger cars are doing.\n\nAnd I think you can do that with parking too.\n\nYou could be like if you want to park a behemoth on the, you know, the on-street.\n\nIt's $2 an hour for everybody except for you in your behemoth.\n\nIt's $17.\n\nBut David, it just, I just feel like so I don't mean to criticize you because I feel like this is the, the set of policy proposal, you know, we sometimes have called ourselves a livable streets movement.\n\nWe've been very focused on streets.\n\nIt just feels to me after 20 years of this, like it's not working that well.\n\nLike, like I don't feel safer on the street on my bike.\n\nI'm not super comfortable with my kids biking still.\n\nAnd it's because we don't really focus on the cars and the car industry products and they keep getting more dangerous.\n\nSo it's like, I really want a set of policies that does something about that.\n\nSo give it to me.\n\nGive it to me, David.\n\nI mean, there's no single policy that's going to fix this sort of like deep hole we've dug ourselves into with, with ubiquitous cars that are often too big and too powerful and too dangerous in this country.\n\nIt's a matter of biting off little pieces of the puzzle and those solutions are going to be partial.\n\nAnd they're also going to depend on the environment in which we're talking about.\n\nLike Peachtree city is a wonderful example that could be emulated by new suburbs that are being built from scratch and master developed.\n\nAnd let's say like the excerpts of Phoenix or Orlando or something like that.\n\nI don't know that Peachtree city has a lot to tell us about what to do in Brooklyn.\n\nRight.\n\nIt's very different.\n\nTo be totally honest.\n\nBut I think what Aaron is saying is, you know, we were talking about Ralph Nader earlier and you know, the impact that his work had on road safety was just so tremendous.\n\nSo outscale.\n\nIt wasn't little nibbles here and there, right?\n\nBecause we got seat belts, we got airbags, we got like saved thousands of lives.\n\nAnd we did that by sitting down in front of the United States Congress and making it crystal clear to the members of Congress and also to the American public that there was a product safety problem that was at least in part motivated by corporate greed, right?\n\nAnd unwillingness to put the money in to do these safety improvements without being forced.\n\nAnd I guess, I mean, we've been talking about this.\n\nWell, it's like we need a Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.\n\nThat's David.\n\nAnd I always thought it was David.\n\nI actually do think I would sometimes read your stuff and I'm like, oh, David could be the Ralph Nader for the people outside the car.\n\nBut it's like what, you know.\n\nSo have you been invited to testify in front of Congress?\n\nAre you going to run for president in 2024?\n\nIs there some scenario in which you could see yourself testifying in front of a committee, you know, you or somebody else and really just opening people's eyes to these, these products are unsafe at any speed?\n\nAt any size.\n\nAt any size, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, Nader's book was transformative for thinking about product safety of cars, right?\n\nAnd how cars were endangering people inside of them.\n\nAlthough I will add one thing, Sarah, to the little history you shared there.\n\nWhen Nader's book first came out unsafe at any speed, it was not immediately a hit.\n\nI think it's important to keep this in mind.\n\nIt was like, you know, some people read it.\n\nIt was okay.\n\nIt was fine.\n\nYou know what turned it into the sort of like breakthrough bestseller transformative book that we know of it?\n\nIt's because General Motors hired detectives to sort of clumsily look for dirt in Nader's background, like trying to like hook him up with prostitutes or whatever, got nowhere.\n\nAnd then this, then this news got out.\n\nAnd when that happened, you guys know this story?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, you don't know this story?\n\nYeah.\n\nI knew that they tried to dig up dirt on him.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThey found nothing.\n\nThey found nothing.\n\nLike Nader is like squeaky clean.\n\nThe news of this investigation got out.\n\nAnd now you have, I think the technical term is a shit show.\n\nAnd GM, this is actually a really fascinating moment in American history.\n\nGM backpedaled.\n\nIt was just one of the biggest corporate cell phones in American history, I would say.\n\nAnd General Motors did a big payout to Nader, who then used that money not to buy himself a new house, but to actually fund these consumer advocacy organizations that basically made him a national here.\n\nSo I just, so I, first of all, I just think the story is fascinating is why I bring it up.\n\nBut also I just want to be clear, it wasn't simply like Nader published the book and everything changed.\n\nNader published a book.\n\nIt did okay.\n\nIt built on some momentum is already coming along.\n\nAnd then General Motors just shot itself in the foot in the biggest way possible.\n\nSo David, you need to write a book, Stellantis needs to like see if you've got any skeletons in your closet and then you'll ride that Streisand effect to banning SUVs.\n\nDone.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nNo, but there's a broader point you were making, which I didn't address yet, which was like, how do you actually get the policymakers to care?\n\nI mean, I live in DC. I've actually spoken with congressmen and representatives and people in power about this.\n\nAnd it's interesting, I was talking with Earl Blumenauer.\n\nYou guys may know him.\n\nHe's about to retire.\n\nAdam on the pod.\n\nHe's a guest on the podcast.\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nFriend of the podcast.\n\nGreat guy.\n\nRight?\n\nLike a hero for people like biking in particular.\n\nI asked him like, what's the deal with car bloat and with cars?\n\nYou know, it's a problem.\n\nIs there any interest among your colleagues to do something?\n\nAnd he basically was like, they're scared shitless of doing anything like that.\n\nEven if they know it's a problem, because there's this this conflation of cars and freedom in the American mind, which automakers have really built up with all their ads and so forth and so on.\n\nAnd he was very candid with me sort of saying, like, look, there's got to be a public push to force us to do something.\n\nAnd this is a guy who wants to do something like there has to be a ground solo support.\n\nAnd that's, you know, just to bring it full circle, look, like you were saying nice things about me.\n\nAnd I appreciate that, but I'll say, like, look, I think you guys and podcasts like yours play an important role, because even if you are like a lot of people you're reaching, I think are already on the team.\n\nNot everyone.\n\nI think there's some who learn about the problems with cars through it.\n\nBut you really need deeper, stronger, broader organizations like this to sort of create the cover for elected leaders to make the decisions that they're just not making right now in Congress and also in a lot of state governments.\n\nThat's what I would say.\n\nI think that's a pretty good place to wrap it up.\n\nYeah, David, we really appreciate, you know, your output.\n\nI think, you know, you're writing so many of these and every now and then something breaks through to Dallas local TV news.\n\nSo we really, we really appreciate it.\n\nYour pen is a sword.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIn the war on cars.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I think you're right.\n\nWe just need to build a much, much bigger team.\n\nAnd you're a great part of that.\n\nSo thank you so much for coming on the war on cars.\n\nNo, it's my pleasure to be with you.\n\nI mentioned a few of my articles and if people are listening or curious to find them, they're all available on my website, which is davidzipper.com.\n\n[^1]:\tThanks to Mammoth's onboarding process, of all gosh darned referrers.\n\n[^2]:\tConsidering he was already a member of my sadly-destined-for-oblivion-at-any-moment, quite prolific [automotive Twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439 \"David Blue's Auto Twitter List\").\n",

One commonly used command is <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code>. You can run the following command in your macOS terminal:</p>\n<pre name=\"de4a\" id=\"de4a\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">top -l 1 | grep \"CPU usage\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"d427\" id=\"d427\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will provide a one-time snapshot of CPU usage. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">-l 1</code> option tells <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> to only run once, and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">grep \"CPU usage\"</code> filters the relevant lines to display CPU usage information.</p>\n<p name=\"4af0\" id=\"4af0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you want continuous monitoring, you can run <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> without <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">-l 1</code> to see real-time updates. Press <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">q</code> to exit <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> when you're done.</p>\n<p name=\"a6c4\" id=\"a6c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can also use specific utilities like <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">htop</code> or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">iStat Menus</code> if you want a more detailed and interactive performance monitoring tool.</p>\n<p name=\"4f0b\" id=\"4f0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Feel free to ask for more details or other performance metrics you’d like to monitor.</p>\n<h4 name=\"4fb9\" id=\"4fb9\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"1d96\" id=\"1d96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Okay, when I ran your snippet, here is the result I got:</p>\n<p name=\"8833\" id=\"8833\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">CPU usage: 5.17% user, 12.93% sys, 81.89% idle</code></p>\n<p name=\"6722\" id=\"6722\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How would I get the combined CPU usage as a percentage value without the labels?</p>\n<h4 name=\"b9fa\" id=\"b9fa\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"15ba\" id=\"15ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To extract the combined CPU usage as a percentage value without the labels, you can use the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command to parse the output from <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code>. Here's how you can modify the command:</p>\n<pre name=\"040d\" id=\"040d\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/CPU usage/ {print $7}'</code></pre>\n<p name=\"06bf\" id=\"06bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will display the combined CPU usage as a percentage value. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command looks for lines containing \"CPU usage\" and prints the 7th column, which is the combined CPU usage percentage.</p>\n<p name=\"2734\" id=\"2734\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you want to calculate and display only the total CPU usage percentage without the labels, this command will do the job for you.</p>\n<h4 name=\"137d\" id=\"137d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"b2e1\" id=\"b2e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">That’s perfect!</p>\n<p name=\"1fba\" id=\"1fba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I’m trying to do is come up with a one-line command to populate values of a widget in the Secure ShellFish app.</p>\n<p name=\"ef35\" id=\"ef35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How would I embed your snippet in the following command so that the output percentage value would replace “PLACEBOLDER”?</p>\n<p name=\"f938\" id=\"f938\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget cpu.fill PLACEHOLDER CPU</code></p>\n<h4 name=\"b34a\" id=\"b34a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"ef4b\" id=\"ef4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To embed the snippet into the command and replace “PLACEHOLDER” with the CPU usage percentage, you can use command substitution. Here’s how you can do it:</p>\n<pre name=\"15c6\" id=\"15c6\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget cpu.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/CPU usage/ {print $7}') CPU\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"e16c\" id=\"e16c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will run the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> command to retrieve the CPU usage percentage and then use it to replace \"PLACEHOLDER\" in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget cpu.fill</code> command. Make sure to include the command substitution <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">$(...)</code> as shown to get the output from the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> and insert it into the Secure ShellFish command.</p>\n<h4 name=\"5d12\" id=\"5d12\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"7e9b\" id=\"7e9b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Perfect! Now, how would I accomplish the same thing, but with the percentage value of current memory used?</p>\n<h4 name=\"ec8a\" id=\"ec8a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"65eb\" id=\"65eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To get the percentage value of current memory used, you can use the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> command again, but this time, you'll need to extract the memory usage information. Here's how you can modify the command to achieve this:</p>\n<pre name=\"75d4\" id=\"75d4\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print $8}') memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"77cc\" id=\"77cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will run the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> command to retrieve the percentage of physical memory used and then use it to replace \"PLACEHOLDER\" in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget memory.fill</code> command. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command extracts the memory usage percentage, which is in the 8th column of the output.</p>\n<h4 name=\"7b4d\" id=\"7b4d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"1086\" id=\"1086\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">When running the following snippet, I seem to be getting an empty value:</p>\n<p name=\"8203\" id=\"8203\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ \\{print $8}'</code></p>\n<p name=\"ba65\" id=\"ba65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But running the following snippet:</p>\n<p name=\"1a25\" id=\"1a25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/'</code></p>\n<p name=\"f839\" id=\"f839\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Returned this value:</p>\n<p name=\"de95\" id=\"de95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">PhysMem: 15G used (1755M wired), 1328M unused.</code></p>\n<p name=\"889e\" id=\"889e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, I’m assuming there needs to be additional manipulation of the output above to convert it into percentage of PhysMem currently used. How would I do that?</p>\n<h4 name=\"2a6e\" id=\"2a6e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"68b6\" id=\"68b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You’re correct; you need to perform additional manipulation to convert the memory usage into a percentage value. Here’s how you can modify the command to achieve that:</p>\n<pre name=\"29bc\" id=\"29bc\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print int(($8 / $2) * 100)}')% memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"b5e2\" id=\"b5e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">In this updated command, we use <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">int(($8 / $2) * 100)</code> to calculate the percentage of physical memory used. It divides the amount used (8th column) by the total physical memory (2nd column) and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage. The result is then appended with \"% memory used\" and used to replace \"PLACEHOLDER\" in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget memory.fill</code> command.</p>\n<p name=\"30d2\" id=\"30d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This should provide you with the percentage of physical memory currently used.</p>\n<h4 name=\"ee2c\" id=\"ee2c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"bfc5\" id=\"bfc5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">That snippet is returning a value of 0, which does not reflect the actual percent memory used value.</p>\n<h4 name=\"ac63\" id=\"ac63\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"d1e7\" id=\"d1e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I apologize for the incorrect command earlier. To calculate the percentage of memory used accurately, you can use the following command:</p>\n<pre name=\"e8dc\" id=\"e8dc\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {used = $8; total = $2; sub(/M/, \"\", used); sub(/G/, \"000M\", total); print int(used / total * 100)}')% memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"cbce\" id=\"cbce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will correctly calculate the percentage of physical memory used by converting both used and total memory to a common unit (in this case, megabytes) and then calculating the percentage.

				"content_html": "<div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p name=\"4c55\" id=\"4c55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">This essay seeks to examine the breadth of donor-funded, open source, federated social networks as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">technical</em> alternatives to commercial online environments like Facebook and Twitter as measured by their users’ overall satisfaction with them as means of social interactivity over time. Following recent debates and confusion regarding the ethics in the practices of the organizations which built them and the extent of their complicity in the radical cultural consequences of digital communication surrounding the United States’ Presidential Election in 2016, it proposes that greater rhetorical and legislative attention be invested in the tangible, documented design decisions across their products’ history as the most crucial, relevant, and effective means of understanding the whole context, within which it will define <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">open source software development</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">federated networking</em> in contrast to the guarded industry establishment which the dominant services have transitioned from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">disrupting</em> by design to entirely exemplifying thus far in the century. After examining conspicuous alterations and inexplicably silent feature additions and subtractions across the whole of social network development, as well as their eventual result’s reflections on the conscious satisfaction of individual Social Media users, it will conclude by profiling a select few communities thriving on donation-funded, collaboratively maintained, and/or decentralized platforms as superior foundations upon which citizens of the web might rebuild their own traumatized and fragmented networks when they are ready to begin again.</p>\n<h3 name=\"7d41\" id=\"7d41\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Introduction</h3>\n<p name=\"3310\" id=\"3310\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If we accept Electronic Mail as the absolute genesis of what we call “Social Media,” the term becomes inextricably linked with <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" data-href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the history of the World Wide Web as a whole</a>. The technical protocol we know as Email is by nature “decentralized,” “distributed,” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> “federated” as the terms are used in this essay because it is technically unbeholden to any single transmission or client service — commercial or not — and it allows users to participate with any server installation they choose, up to and including personal email servers <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" data-href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">installed in one’s home</a>. In this essay, “decentralized social networks,” “distributed social platforms,” and “federated social networking” fall together under the category of “open web technologies,” which are <a href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" data-href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by definition non-proprietary</a>. This essay proceeds under the notable assumption that The Web as a whole “was, at its core and in its design, a democratizing technology,” and that its potential to be more “open” will remain limitless as long as its <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" data-href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental structure is at all recognizable as The Web</a>. In fact, using the adjectives “decentralized” and “distributed” in front of any web-native technologies could be considered oxymoronic, as The Web’s existence as an entity comprised of many interconnecting interconnections without any requisite central spaces or governing bodies remains technically unmolested, despite the encroaching would-be for-profit adjudicators Google and Facebook. (While the abrupt and total disappearance of either or both company’s total online proprietorship would be a massive event, the remainder of The Web would continue to function.)</p>\n<p name=\"b89f\" id=\"b89f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Email is undoubtedly a form of social <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">networking</em>, though it was the addition of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) — a parallel technology — that manifested what many scholars have offered as the first published media for the sake of socializing online. Four key pillars of Social Media services in their <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">current</em> form were arrived upon within an editorial issue <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" data-href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduction for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Telecommunications Policy</em></a>:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li name=\"13ce\" id=\"13ce\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The software powering Social Media services are definitive “Web 2.0” properties, as platforms “for creating and publishing content, and also [places] where content can be ‘continuously modified by all users in a participatory and collaborative fashion.’”</li>\n<li name=\"d4cc\" id=\"d4cc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services are primarily driven by <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">User</em>-Generated Content.</li>\n<li name=\"f268\" id=\"f268\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services include a directorial functionality which enables users to create “profiles” to represent themselves.</li>\n<li name=\"9c58\" id=\"9c58\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services “facilitate the development of social networks” by the interconnection of user profiles as units.</li>\n</ol>\n<p name=\"5314\" id=\"5314\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In 1996, Poet, Grateful Dead ghostwriter, and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation John Perry Barlow published a manifesto entitled <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" data-href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em></a> which proves an insightful abstract into the most romanticized, principled, and abstractly ideological thought of that period surrounding The Web’s future.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"c50c\" id=\"c50c\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"eac7\" id=\"eac7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">From our retrospective, the bravado in Barlow’s declarations addressed specifically to “Governments of the Industrial World” presents an important contrast on which to reflect. Current events surrounding regulation of the tech industry reflect a general desire for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">more</em> government intervention from both mainstream political parties in the United States. As I write, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an appearance by the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook</a> in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee has just concluded, during which both fielded questions from senators of both mainstream parties, largely regarding “censorship” on their platforms performed by the companies themselves. It is beyond the scope of this essay to address the particulars of this issue, so we are going to continue under the assumption that privately-owned social platforms have the constitutional right to censor, manipulate, or otherwise editorialize User-Generated Content (UGC) as­ they see fit, but it will outline specific advantages with regard to “The Censorship Issue” offered by current Federated Social platforms. The reality of Barlow’s fears in 2020: even if the United States government had intentions to regulate speech on The Web, it has consistently demonstrated an inability to comprehend the meaning of such action, much less an ability to enforce legislation within the realm of online speech.</p>\n<p name=\"f447\" id=\"f447\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This essay cites heavily from meta-media publications like the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Columbia Journalism Review</em> and Harvard’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Nieman Lab</em>, as well as from several individual articles oriented around the subject of social media’s impact on the way news is consumed, skewing its bias toward the media industry in many ways. I pursued this direction in order to make what I believe to be an original suggestion: Federated Social Platforms are ideal solutions to this issue, too, largely because of their widespread omission of any non-linear (algorithmic) content prioritization in timelines. Much like Twitter’s original design, content on services like Mastodon and Diaspora appears in a purely-chronological “Timeline,” which — if still present — is now a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highly-obscured option</a> in mainstream proprietary networks. Inevitably, it discusses recent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms (which I will occasionally refer to as “Big Social”) to reform aggregative processes within their functions as news-sharing services as it cites the research critics have referenced in response.</p>\n<h4 name=\"458f\" id=\"458f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Origins</h4>\n<p name=\"3b33\" id=\"3b33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While user-maintained Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) like Usenet and Fidonet established Open Web forums in the 1980s, a proprietary parallel called CompuServe migrated from its original implementation as a “<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" data-href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business-oriented mainframe computer communication solution</a>” to the public domain. As of Fall 1994, CompuServe charged $8.95 per month ($15.94, adjusted for inflation) for “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited use of its standard services</a>,” which included “news, sports, weather, travel, reference libraries, stock quotes, games and limited electronic mail,” and between $4.80 and $22.80 per <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hour</em> ($8.55 to $40.61, adjusted for inflation) for use of its “’extended’ services,” including a variety of discussion forums established by topic.

Theirs begins with the invention of a hardware project by “open Internet activist” Eben Moglen in 2010 “with the aim of shifting away from large, corporate owned server farms to a more community-oriented model for managing communications online,” called Freedom Box, and its relationship with Diaspora, the first federated SNS. The Diaspora project was launched by a group of Moglen’s students at Columbia University, originally intended a “distributed social networking service that addressed consumer privacy concerns by enabling users to host their own content on a friendly community device, like Freedom Box.” This vision depended on Moglen’s heavy emphasis on self-hosted servers as the primary means for users to maintain their privacy, going forward.</p>\n<p name=\"456f\" id=\"456f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">WIRED</em> article citing the study entitled “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" data-href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized Social Networks Sound Great.

Just five months after Mastodon’s first penetration of the mainstream tech conversation in April of 2017 — with its default 500-character post limit and support for up to 5000 — Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced its upcoming expansion from 140 to 280 characters</a>.

While Twitter had long supported similar metadata in images, it did not do so on its main web interface (twitter.com,) Tweetdeck, nor its mobile apps until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">May 27th of this year</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"1b88\" id=\"1b88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many Mastodon instance administrators and invested users had added feature requests on the platform’s GitHub repository for media posts to support audio playback intermittently throughout its development history, but Rochko initially resisted out of fears that allowing users to share audio files in posts would lead to Mastodon being “<a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">branded as a pirate music sharing service, and [their] project would end up getting blocked in search results</a>.” Feedback would appear to have pressured him into giving in to this decision, as audio file uploads were quietly allowed in <a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 2.9.1 of the platform</a>, released on June 22, 2019.</p>\n<p name=\"5f0f\" id=\"5f0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Almost exactly one year later, Twitter first <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced testing for “Voice Tweets” on June 17, 2020</a>, which would not allow audio file upload but instead restrict users to recording within the Twitter mobile app in 140 second-long segments.

Following recent debates and confusion regarding the ethics in the practices of the organizations which built them and the extent of their complicity in the radical cultural consequences of digital communication surrounding the United States’ Presidential Election in 2016, it proposes that greater rhetorical and legislative attention be invested in the tangible, documented design decisions across their products’ history as the most crucial, relevant, and effective means of understanding the whole context, within which it will define <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">open source software development</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">federated networking</em> in contrast to the guarded industry establishment which the dominant services have transitioned from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">disrupting</em> by design to entirely exemplifying thus far in the century. After examining conspicuous alterations and inexplicably silent feature additions and subtractions across the whole of social network development, as well as their eventual result’s reflections on the conscious satisfaction of individual Social Media users, it will conclude by profiling a select few communities thriving on donation-funded, collaboratively maintained, and/or decentralized platforms as superior foundations upon which citizens of the web might rebuild their own traumatized and fragmented networks when they are ready to begin again.</p>\n<h3 name=\"7d41\" id=\"7d41\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Introduction</h3>\n<p name=\"3310\" id=\"3310\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If we accept Electronic Mail as the absolute genesis of what we call “Social Media,” the term becomes inextricably linked with <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" data-href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the history of the World Wide Web as a whole</a>. The technical protocol we know as Email is by nature “decentralized,” “distributed,” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> “federated” as the terms are used in this essay because it is technically unbeholden to any single transmission or client service — commercial or not — and it allows users to participate with any server installation they choose, up to and including personal email servers <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" data-href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">installed in one’s home</a>. In this essay, “decentralized social networks,” “distributed social platforms,” and “federated social networking” fall together under the category of “open web technologies,” which are <a href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" data-href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by definition non-proprietary</a>. This essay proceeds under the notable assumption that The Web as a whole “was, at its core and in its design, a democratizing technology,” and that its potential to be more “open” will remain limitless as long as its <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" data-href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental structure is at all recognizable as The Web</a>. In fact, using the adjectives “decentralized” and “distributed” in front of any web-native technologies could be considered oxymoronic, as The Web’s existence as an entity comprised of many interconnecting interconnections without any requisite central spaces or governing bodies remains technically unmolested, despite the encroaching would-be for-profit adjudicators Google and Facebook. (While the abrupt and total disappearance of either or both company’s total online proprietorship would be a massive event, the remainder of The Web would continue to function.)</p>\n<p name=\"b89f\" id=\"b89f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Email is undoubtedly a form of social <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">networking</em>, though it was the addition of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) — a parallel technology — that manifested what many scholars have offered as the first published media for the sake of socializing online. Four key pillars of Social Media services in their <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">current</em> form were arrived upon within an editorial issue <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" data-href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduction for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Telecommunications Policy</em></a>:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li name=\"13ce\" id=\"13ce\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The software powering Social Media services are definitive “Web 2.0” properties, as platforms “for creating and publishing content, and also [places] where content can be ‘continuously modified by all users in a participatory and collaborative fashion.’”</li>\n<li name=\"d4cc\" id=\"d4cc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services are primarily driven by <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">User</em>-Generated Content.</li>\n<li name=\"f268\" id=\"f268\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services include a directorial functionality which enables users to create “profiles” to represent themselves.</li>\n<li name=\"9c58\" id=\"9c58\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services “facilitate the development of social networks” by the interconnection of user profiles as units.</li>\n</ol>\n<p name=\"5314\" id=\"5314\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In 1996, Poet, Grateful Dead ghostwriter, and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation John Perry Barlow published a manifesto entitled <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" data-href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em></a> which proves an insightful abstract into the most romanticized, principled, and abstractly ideological thought of that period surrounding The Web’s future.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"c50c\" id=\"c50c\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"eac7\" id=\"eac7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">From our retrospective, the bravado in Barlow’s declarations addressed specifically to “Governments of the Industrial World” presents an important contrast on which to reflect. Current events surrounding regulation of the tech industry reflect a general desire for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">more</em> government intervention from both mainstream political parties in the United States. As I write, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an appearance by the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook</a> in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee has just concluded, during which both fielded questions from senators of both mainstream parties, largely regarding “censorship” on their platforms performed by the companies themselves. It is beyond the scope of this essay to address the particulars of this issue, so we are going to continue under the assumption that privately-owned social platforms have the constitutional right to censor, manipulate, or otherwise editorialize User-Generated Content (UGC) as­ they see fit, but it will outline specific advantages with regard to “The Censorship Issue” offered by current Federated Social platforms. The reality of Barlow’s fears in 2020: even if the United States government had intentions to regulate speech on The Web, it has consistently demonstrated an inability to comprehend the meaning of such action, much less an ability to enforce legislation within the realm of online speech.</p>\n<p name=\"f447\" id=\"f447\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This essay cites heavily from meta-media publications like the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Columbia Journalism Review</em> and Harvard’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Nieman Lab</em>, as well as from several individual articles oriented around the subject of social media’s impact on the way news is consumed, skewing its bias toward the media industry in many ways. I pursued this direction in order to make what I believe to be an original suggestion: Federated Social Platforms are ideal solutions to this issue, too, largely because of their widespread omission of any non-linear (algorithmic) content prioritization in timelines. Much like Twitter’s original design, content on services like Mastodon and Diaspora appears in a purely-chronological “Timeline,” which — if still present — is now a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highly-obscured option</a> in mainstream proprietary networks. Inevitably, it discusses recent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms (which I will occasionally refer to as “Big Social”) to reform aggregative processes within their functions as news-sharing services as it cites the research critics have referenced in response.</p>\n<h4 name=\"458f\" id=\"458f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Origins</h4>\n<p name=\"3b33\" id=\"3b33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While user-maintained Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) like Usenet and Fidonet established Open Web forums in the 1980s, a proprietary parallel called CompuServe migrated from its original implementation as a “<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" data-href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business-oriented mainframe computer communication solution</a>” to the public domain.

SixDegrees was notable as “one of the very first [Social Networks] to allow its users to create profiles, invite friends, organize groups, and surf other user profiles.” Following social development of the original services goliaths and these insular collegiate networks, another microcosm sprouted up within this first generation of ethnic-oriented networks such as AsianAvenue.com and BlackPlanet.com, which both continue operation to date.</p>\n<h4 name=\"7b31\" id=\"7b31\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The Friendly Frenzy</h4>\n<p name=\"fb29\" id=\"fb29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The meat of the social media industry’s curve throughout its history up to this point is occupied by a string of networks — most forgotten — following the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hallmark of Friendster’s launch in 2002</a>. A year later, LinkedIn was launched as the “more sober,” business-oriented network offering. MySpace — “once the perennial favorite” also launched in 2003. Then, in 2004, TheFacebook.com launched within Harvard University as a means for students to “<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/\" data-href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">search for others in their courses, social organizations and Houses</a>.” Almost immediately (just six days later,) the service’s extensive legal history began when three fellow Harvard students accused founder Mark Zuckerberg of “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com</a>.”</p>\n<p name=\"2891\" id=\"2891\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is difficult to find an examination of Facebook’s commercial success from a critical perspective among technology media that has almost entirely embedded itself within the industry it claims to keep in cheque. The vast majority of technology press organizations are based in either Silicon Valley or New York City. The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Digital Trends</em> article I have just cited heavily from goes on to suggest that it’s a “universal agreement” that “Facebook promotes both honesty and openness,” when an examination of the discourse surrounding Facebook outside of technology culture suggests otherwise. Much of the related literature from academia surrounds the company’s perceived mishandling of “Big Data” and a broad discussion of “privacy” and its perceived new meaning.</p>\n<h3 name=\"a5bd\" id=\"a5bd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Facebook’s Fallout</h3>\n<p name=\"6730\" id=\"6730\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Since the “Cambridge Analytica scandal,” legal attention toward Facebook has become popularized in conversation, so the dissemination of related details is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>\n<h4 name=\"4f80\" id=\"4f80\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Pro-Transparency Within Facebook Inc.</h4>\n<p name=\"d9fa\" id=\"d9fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Facebook, Inc. claims to have made a significant effort to become more transparent, especially since Mark Zuckerberg began appearing in front of special senate judiciary committee hearings in 2017. “Facebook Open Source” publishes regular content on <a href=\"https://opensource.facebook.com/\" data-href=\"https://opensource.facebook.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opensource.facebook.com</a>, including a podcast called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Diff</em>.

It’s gonna improve either something in the industry — it might be a new, novel approach to solving a problem… Something that we built internally and want to share with the world.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"0cf8\" id=\"0cf8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Critics of Open Source development suggest that major companies like Facebook are often only interested in making projects public for the sake of “<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/43zak3/the-internet-was-built-on-the-free-labor-of-open-source-developers-is-that-sustainable\" data-href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/43zak3/the-internet-was-built-on-the-free-labor-of-open-source-developers-is-that-sustainable\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free labor</a>” by outside contributors.</p>\n<h3 name=\"fd3d\" id=\"fd3d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Parallel Fediverse</h3>\n<p name=\"747f\" id=\"747f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">A documented history of Federated social networks is lacking, but a 2017 report by MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative entitled “<a href=\"https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb\" data-href=\"https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Defending Internet Freedom Through Decentralization</a>” offers the most comprehensive review I was able to find on the subject. Theirs begins with the invention of a hardware project by “open Internet activist” Eben Moglen in 2010 “with the aim of shifting away from large, corporate owned server farms to a more community-oriented model for managing communications online,” called Freedom Box, and its relationship with Diaspora, the first federated SNS. The Diaspora project was launched by a group of Moglen’s students at Columbia University, originally intended a “distributed social networking service that addressed consumer privacy concerns by enabling users to host their own content on a friendly community device, like Freedom Box.” This vision depended on Moglen’s heavy emphasis on self-hosted servers as the primary means for users to maintain their privacy, going forward.</p>\n<p name=\"456f\" id=\"456f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">WIRED</em> article citing the study entitled “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" data-href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>,” Barabas suggests that “most people do not want to run their own web servers or social network nodes.” Diaspora exists today entirely separate of its original creators after its “young leaders” faltered under pressure from investor pressure to “’pivot’ the project to a more sustainable business model,” now in the hands of “the open source community.” As of November 2020, ~76000 total users were registered on Diaspora instances (called “nodes” by the community,) with approximately 17000 active in the past month.</p>\n<h4 name=\"8dec\" id=\"8dec\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Big Social, Overtaken</h4>\n<p name=\"bf2d\" id=\"bf2d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Since 2017, the relationship between Mastodon and Twitter has exhibited a complete role reversal in key feature additions. While almost all of the articles and essays on the subject are keen to point out that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/\" data-href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eugen Rochko modeled Tootsuite’s original UI after Tweetdeck</a> (now an optional selection called “Advanced UI,”) the “mimicry” between the donor-funded, Open Source platform headed by a single German developer in his twenties and the 15-year-old for-profit social network maintained by a company with nearly 5000 employees shifts in the other direction upon close examination of specific featuresets. Just five months after Mastodon’s first penetration of the mainstream tech conversation in April of 2017 — with its default 500-character post limit and support for up to 5000 — Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced its upcoming expansion from 140 to 280 characters</a>. In October, 2017, with <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon’s second version release</a>, support for image descriptions (alt text) for the sake of accessibility was introduced. While Twitter had long supported similar metadata in images, it did not do so on its main web interface (twitter.com,) Tweetdeck, nor its mobile apps until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">May 27th of this year</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"1b88\" id=\"1b88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many Mastodon instance administrators and invested users had added feature requests on the platform’s GitHub repository for media posts to support audio playback intermittently throughout its development history, but Rochko initially resisted out of fears that allowing users to share audio files in posts would lead to Mastodon being “<a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">branded as a pirate music sharing service, and [their] project would end up getting blocked in search results</a>.” Feedback would appear to have pressured him into giving in to this decision, as audio file uploads were quietly allowed in <a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 2.9.1 of the platform</a>, released on June 22, 2019.</p>\n<p name=\"5f0f\" id=\"5f0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Almost exactly one year later, Twitter first <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced testing for “Voice Tweets” on June 17, 2020</a>, which would not allow audio file upload but instead restrict users to recording within the Twitter mobile app in 140 second-long segments. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controversy ensued</a> regarding Twitter’s omission of any efforts to transcribe Voice Tweets, further catalyzed by the subsequent discovery that the company did not have an internal team dedicated to accessibility.</p>\n<p name=\"4247\" id=\"4247\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is still not known at the time of this writing whether or not Voice Tweets have been fully “rolled out” to all eligible Twitter clients, but Mastodon’s latest <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.2 release</a> from August 2020 included an extensive rework of audio players in posts:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"70e5\" id=\"70e5\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"0240\" id=\"0240\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">These features are hardly comparable except for their common disuse. Data regarding status type is no longer publicly accessible for either platform, but my personal experience as a heavy user of both suggests that audio posts are generally not a priority.</p>\n<p name=\"939a\" id=\"939a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the most popular laments of Twitter users for virtually its entire history surrounds the inability to edit Tweets after they have been posted. When I <a href=\"https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview\" data-href=\"https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed Eugen Rochko in 2017</a>, he explained the central issue with implementing such a capability from his perspective:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"a7a1\" id=\"a7a1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">That won’t happen. There’s actually a good reason why they don’t do that. It’s for the very simple reason that you could make a Toot about one thing, have lots of people favorite share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly it says “heil Hitler,” or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"1e19\" id=\"1e19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing\">Instead of live editing a specific status update, <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon’s Summer 2018 response to the issue</a> — called “Delete &amp; Re-Draft” — allows the user to edit the contents of a post in the compose interface immediately following its deletion, so that no information need be revised while live on the network. Rumors and bugs have contributed to an extensive mythos surrounding editable statuses in Twitter’s case, but CEO Jack Dorsey did explicitly address the possibility in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a Q&amp;A published by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">WIRED</em></a> in January 2020, saying, simply, “we’ll probably never do it.”</p>\n</div></div>\n",

For macOS users, there's also a bespoke Catalyst app called <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/misc/mail-assistant\">Mail Assistant</a>, which I've yet to try.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"formatting\" id=\"formatting\">Formatting</h2>\n\n<p>The parameters of <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail\">the Mail action step</a> can be filled with any combination of items from <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/drafts-templates\">the original Drafts template tags array</a> <em>or</em> from the relatively new set of <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/mustache.html\">mustache template tags</a>.</p>\n\n<p><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/extratone/8cc2cd8cc7b8e95a80f9e60b5fe71bd4.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The current version of <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1wR\">my personal Send-to-Self action</a> sent <a href=\"https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/GFZ2OLZskkVOrDVslliHP_H7lalF_81dS00IvpJv\">this example result</a> using the format represented in the Gist embedded above. If you'd like, you can wrap the [body] tag (or any part of the message, actually) in double %s and select the <code>Send as HTML</code> toggle to have the result rendered as HTML. (See <a href=\"https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/elWlx8eNRiw1nWICBT5p7eGcTs5XZsFO6-JuM1n1\">this example</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/190239278-4f5e7f12-37c1-4ad9-9c2e-7d7e76000f88.png\" alt=\"Setting a Drafts Mail-to-Self-specific rule on iCloud Mail on the Web\"/></p>\n\n<p>If – like me – you're an iCloud Mail user primarily from iOS/iPadOS, here's how to create an iCloud Mail rule for messages you've sent yourself from Drafts:</p>\n<ol><li>Visit <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/mail/\">iCloud.com/mail</a> in your web browser and authenticate.</li>\n<li>Open the Rules settings menu by tapping the gear icon in the upper left ⇨ Preferences ⇨ Rules.</li>\n<li>Create a new rule with the “Add rule” link.</li>\n<li>By default, the “If a message...” field selection should be “is from.” In the text entry field, enter <code>drafts-mail@drafts5.agiletortoise.com</code>.</li>\n<li>By default, the “Then...” field selection is “Move to Folder.” I have personally set mine to “Move to Folder and Mark as Read,” but this depends on your preference. Select a folder or mailbox for Drafts messages to be moved to and click “Add.”</li></ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"publishing-via-email\" id=\"publishing-via-email\">Publishing via Email</h2>\n\n<p>I've spent a lot of time this year working on integrating Drafts with <a href=\"https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities\">NeoCities</a>, <a href=\"https://bilge.world/automating-writeas-posts\">Write.as</a>, and other publishing services, but – for new users, especially – Drafts' mail integration offers a pathway to publishing with virtually zero configuration for those services who still offer mail-to-save/post email addresses. These include <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/post-by-email/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/154172?hl=en#:~:text=Click Save.-,to post by email:,-Important: Anyone who\">Blogger</a>, <a href=\"https://howto.write.as/publish-via-email\">Write.as</a>, <a href=\"https://www.livejournal.com/support/faq/187.html\">LiveJournal</a>, <a href=\"https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050995914\">Evernote</a>, <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/create-entries-with-email/\">Day One</a>, <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2908262/\">Things</a>, <a href=\"https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/email-tasks-into-todoist\">Todoist</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the easiest method of setting this up would involve finding your private email address for a given service(s), pasting them in the aforementioned <a href=\"https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail\">Mail Action Wizard</a>, titling the action by the name of the service, and installing. There's also an <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Mr\">Email to Myself action</a> on the Drafts Action Directory to get you started.</p>\n\n<video controls=\"\">\n  <source src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/189246053-c53d970a-a6ea-48da-8878-116d0abf2a2b.MOV\">\n</video>\n\n<h3 id=\"drag-and-drop-to-formatted-markdown-hyperlinks-from-apple-mail\" id=\"drag-and-drop-to-formatted-markdown-hyperlinks-from-apple-mail\">Drag and Drop to <em>Formatted</em> Markdown Hyperlinks from Apple Mail</h3>\n\n<p>Going the other direction, users of Apple Mail (the client) might find it pleasantly surprising that one can drag a message from Mail into Drafts in order to automatically create a markdown-formatted hyperlink that opens said message from anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>For more details, see the official <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/sending-mail-with-drafts/3597\"><strong>'Sending Mail with Drafts' Integration Guide</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://remark.as/p/bilge.world/drafts-mail-integration\">Discuss...</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bilge.world/tag:software\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">software</span></a></p>\n",

I doubt you want to hear much about it, but the issue of actually <em>obtaining audio files</em> from the Screw collection is a worthwhile one to engage for context's sake. I was first introduced to the ~343-chapter collection by my high school best friend, who'd acquired it via an ancient Pirate Bay torrent some hero set up in the early 2000s[^1]. It was complete – probably – and more or less correctly organized <em>by chapter</em>, but that's about it as far as reliable metadata was concerned. The results one would find elsewhere on the web, from <a href=\"https://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=keyword:dj+screw\">sites like DatPiff</a>, were hardly any better – many, in fact, were obviously sourced from that same torrent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/WB5CXuSz.png\" alt=\"DJ Screw on the iTunes Store and Apple Music\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709?itsct=music_box_badge&itscg=30200&app=music&ls=1\" style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"><img src=\"https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/listen-on-apple-music/badge/en-us?size=250x83&h=cdbcefe9e23b0310ab61b31e72e2dcdb\" alt=\"Listen on Apple Music\" style=\"border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In the interim, a lot has changed about music consumption. You know this, but – as you might've already imagined – none of the mainstream services you fuckers partake in have managed to do Robert Earl Davis III justice in the modern era. <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709\">Apple Music</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TC6ZeVdvCuBSn32h5Msul\">Spotify</a>, both, will send you in neatly identical spirals pretty much regardless which of their pet vectors you choose to populate with His Name. As much as I've vouched for the former, it's perhaps the worst of them all in this context – departing the marque entirely into the (respectable but... incorrect) world of non-Davis <em>SLOWED 'n” THOWED</em>[^2] almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one day, I'll find it within myself to tackle this issue – DJ Screw in the Щ́̇͋ͯ̋̅Σ̾̒͋ͯͭ ̊ᄂ̋̈͐İͬV̏̆̊͛̍̌Σ̆ͣͣͭ͐ͫ̆̊ ͪͬ̿̈́̑ͤ̚IͫП̎̿͑ͦ͆̚ ͣͫ͌ͨ̈Λ̃͛̓ͦͪ͒̑̽ ͛̑ͤ͊ͭƬ̒I̅͌̊̑ͧͪM̈́̓Σ̋̏͂͐͊͆ͣ, generally – but I actually have extremely wonderful, urgent news. You see, dearest archive.org was actually provided <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dj-screw-discography\"><strong>the entire, impeccably tagged Discography</strong></a> by actual Culture Heroes some years ago. All of it, accessible in multiple file formats, embeddable, superbly shareable! This is the most important truth I have to impart to you today, really, but – for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, there's even more...</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://archive.org/details/dj-screw-discography&playlist=1&list_height=150\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"automation\" id=\"automation\">Automation</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/K6iHUgs0.png\" alt=\"Download Random Screw Tape Shortcut\"/></p>\n<p>As of right now, just two Siri Shortcuts – <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12610\"><strong>Download Random Screw Tape</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12618\"><strong>DJ Screw Discography</strong></a>[^3].

I doubt you want to hear much about it, but the issue of actually <em>obtaining audio files</em> from the Screw collection is a worthwhile one to engage for context's sake. I was first introduced to the ~343-chapter collection by my high school best friend, who'd acquired it via an ancient Pirate Bay torrent some hero set up in the early 2000s[^1]. It was complete – probably – and more or less correctly organized <em>by chapter</em>, but that's about it as far as reliable metadata was concerned. The results one would find elsewhere on the web, from <a href=\"https://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=keyword:dj+screw\">sites like DatPiff</a>, were hardly any better – many, in fact, were obviously sourced from that same torrent.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/WB5CXuSz.png\" alt=\"DJ Screw on the iTunes Store and Apple Music\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709?itsct=music_box_badge&itscg=30200&app=music&ls=1\" style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"><img src=\"https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/listen-on-apple-music/badge/en-us?size=250x83&h=cdbcefe9e23b0310ab61b31e72e2dcdb\" alt=\"Listen on Apple Music\" style=\"border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the interim, a lot has changed about music consumption. You know this, but – as you might've already imagined – none of the mainstream services you fuckers partake in have managed to do Robert Earl Davis III justice in the modern era. <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709\">Apple Music</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TC6ZeVdvCuBSn32h5Msul\">Spotify</a>, both, will send you in neatly identical spirals pretty much regardless which of their pet vectors you choose to populate with His Name. As much as I've vouched for the former, it's perhaps the worst of them all in this context – departing the marque entirely into the (respectable but... incorrect) world of non-Davis <em>SLOWED 'n” THOWED</em>[^2] almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one day, I'll find it within myself to tackle this issue – DJ Screw in the Щ́̇͋ͯ̋̅Σ̾̒͋ͯͭ ̊ᄂ̋̈͐İͬV̏̆̊͛̍̌Σ̆ͣͣͭ͐ͫ̆̊ ͪͬ̿̈́̑ͤ̚IͫП̎̿͑ͦ͆̚ ͣͫ͌ͨ̈Λ̃͛̓ͦͪ͒̑̽ ͛̑ͤ͊ͭƬ̒I̅͌̊̑ͧͪM̈́̓Σ̋̏͂͐͊͆ͣ, generally – but I actually have extremely wonderful, urgent news.

One of <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners\">its winners</a> – a shortcut called “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/68b1d8edadb9446599c90d988ef21eb3\">What's on KUTX</a>?” credited to Jack Wellborn – caught my eye as a lifelong dependent upon National Public Radio. Via <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners/#whats-on-kutx-a-music-discovery-shortcut\">John Voorhees' comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The solution Wellborn came up with is ingenious. It turns out that KUTX uses a web API that can return information about the currently playing track. The API is used to drive an ‘On Now’ widget on the station’s website, but Wellborn discovered that they could query the API and get the track information back as JSON. So, they built a shortcut that queries the API when run, returning the info about the currently-playing song.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I began playing around with <a href=\"https://api.composer.nprstations.org\">the NPR API</a> Jack used and discovered quite accidentally that their shortcut could be modified to display current <em>program</em> information for those NPR stations that are <em>not</em> music-oriented, like mine. For the vast majority of the 24-hour cycle, <a href=\"https://www.kbia.org/about\">KBIA</a> – “Mid-Missouri's NPR station” – plays news programs, mostly from NPR, itself, supplanted by BBC news late at night.</p>\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hey locals!

One of <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners\">its winners</a> – a shortcut called “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/68b1d8edadb9446599c90d988ef21eb3\">What's on KUTX</a>?” credited to Jack Wellborn – caught my eye as a lifelong dependent upon National Public Radio. Via <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners/#whats-on-kutx-a-music-discovery-shortcut\">John Voorhees' comment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The solution Wellborn came up with is ingenious. It turns out that KUTX uses a web API that can return information about the currently playing track. The API is used to drive an ‘On Now’ widget on the station’s website, but Wellborn discovered that they could query the API and get the track information back as JSON. So, they built a shortcut that queries the API when run, returning the info about the currently-playing song.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I began playing around with <a href=\"https://api.composer.nprstations.org\">the NPR API</a> Jack used and discovered quite accidentally that their shortcut could be modified to display current <em>program</em> information for those NPR stations that are <em>not</em> music-oriented, like mine. For the vast majority of the 24-hour cycle, <a href=\"https://www.kbia.org/about\">KBIA</a> – “Mid-Missouri's NPR station” – plays news programs, mostly from NPR, itself, supplanted by BBC news late at night.</p>\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hey locals!

I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line – a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243\"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438\"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png\" alt=\"iSH Shell and a-Shell\"/></p>\n<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href=\"https://alpinelinux.org\">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/\">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell\">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306\"><strong>Blink Shell & Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png\" alt=\"bbj Out\"/></p>\n<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps\">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href=\"https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/\">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for – “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png\" alt=\"Apreche Reply\"/></p>\n<p>Since I’ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739\">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone\">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community – a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136\">public pages</a> – exclusively through <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/jorts\">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this – note <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~apreche\">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above – but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>\n<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png\" alt=\"Blink Settings\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"locally\" id=\"locally\">Locally</h2>\n<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/fonts\">fonts</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes\">themes</a> – you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js\">CLRS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js\">Man Page</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js\">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png\" alt=\"Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage\"/></p>\n<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png\" alt=\"Repository Cleaning\"/></p>\n<p>Linking <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge\"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807\">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png\" alt=\"BaityYouTubeThumbnail\"/></p>\n<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png\" alt=\"Blink and Code\"/></p>\n<p>Blink’s own “<a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup\">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command\">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png\" alt=\"Blink Keyboard Shortcuts\"/></p>\n<h3 id=\"keyboarding\" id=\"keyboarding\">Keyboarding</h3>\n<p>To its credit, I think <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>\n<p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af\">O P E N</a>.” Or – in the case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3\">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/\">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png\" alt=\"Blink Custom Key Presses\"/></p>\n<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567\">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png\" alt=\"Importing Keys in Blink Shell\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh\" id=\"remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh\">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>\n<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html\">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~vilmibm\">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png\" alt=\"Blink Autocomplete\"/></p>\n<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100\">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png\" alt=\"Adding Files App Locations in Blink\"/></p>\n<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app\">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png\" alt=\"Blink File Providers\"/></p>\n<p>To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:</p>\n<h3 id=\"mini-tutorial-uploading-images-to-the-tildeverse-with-blink-shell-https-user-images-githubusercontent-com-43663476-193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a-mov\" id=\"mini-tutorial-uploading-images-to-the-tildeverse-with-blink-shell-https-user-images-githubusercontent-com-43663476-193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a-mov\">Mini Tutorial: <a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell</a></h3>\n<video controls=\"\">\n  <source src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">\n</video>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/mz8lgDFt.png\" alt=\"Novel Chat Fixed\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"chat\" id=\"chat\">Chat</h2>\n<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href=\"https://weechat.org\">WeeChat</a> and – especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/\">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>\n<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh\">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink\">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,\n  “AltitudeRef” : 0,\n  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,\n  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,\n  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,\n  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,\n  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,\n  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,\n  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,\n  “DOP” : 35\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>\n<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478\">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href=\"http://limechat.net/iphone/\">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>\n<h4 id=\"weechat-configuration\" id=\"weechat-configuration\">WeeChat Configuration</h4>\n<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~m455\">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way.

As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020\">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png\" alt=\"Blink Appearance Settings\"/></p>\n<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window\">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png\" alt=\"Notifications in Blink\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"other-considerations\" id=\"other-considerations\">Other Considerations</h2>\n<p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&cmd=</code> – but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/\">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above – and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>\n<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>\n<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer.

I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line – a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243\"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438\"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png\" alt=\"iSH Shell and a-Shell\"/></p>\n\n<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href=\"https://alpinelinux.org\">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/\">SW-DLT</a> – a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell\">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306\"><strong>Blink Shell & Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png\" alt=\"bbj Out\"/></p>\n\n<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps\">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href=\"https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/\">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for – “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png\" alt=\"Apreche Reply\"/></p>\n\n<p>Since I’ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739\">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone\">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community – a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136\">public pages</a> – exclusively through <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/jorts\">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this – note <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~apreche\">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above – but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>\n\n<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png\" alt=\"Blink Settings\"/></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"locally\" id=\"locally\">Locally</h2>\n\n<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/fonts\">fonts</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes\">themes</a> – you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js\">CLRS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js\">Man Page</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js\">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png\" alt=\"Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage\"/></p>\n\n<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png\" alt=\"Repository Cleaning\"/></p>\n\n<p>Linking <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge\"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807\">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png\" alt=\"BaityYouTubeThumbnail\"/></p>\n\n<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad – which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings – it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png\" alt=\"Blink and Code\"/></p>\n\n<p>Blink’s own “<a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup\">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command\">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png\" alt=\"Blink Keyboard Shortcuts\"/></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keyboarding\" id=\"keyboarding\">Keyboarding</h3>\n\n<p>To its credit, I think <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>\n\n<p>After a link is selected – which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line – I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af\">O P E N</a>.” Or – in the case of a direct link to a file – I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3\">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/\">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png\" alt=\"Blink Custom Key Presses\"/></p>\n\n<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567\">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png\" alt=\"Importing Keys in Blink Shell\"/></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh\" id=\"remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh\">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html\">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~vilmibm\">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png\" alt=\"Blink Autocomplete\"/></p>\n\n<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100\">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png\" alt=\"Adding Files App Locations in Blink\"/></p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app\">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png\" alt=\"Blink File Providers\"/></p>\n\n<p>To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mini-tutorial-uploading-images-to-the-tildeverse-with-blink-shell-https-user-images-githubusercontent-com-43663476-193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a-mov\" id=\"mini-tutorial-uploading-images-to-the-tildeverse-with-blink-shell-https-user-images-githubusercontent-com-43663476-193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a-mov\">Mini Tutorial: <a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell</a></h3>\n\n<video controls=\"\">\n  <source src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">\n</video>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/mz8lgDFt.png\" alt=\"Novel Chat Fixed\"/></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"chat\" id=\"chat\">Chat</h2>\n\n<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href=\"https://weechat.org\">WeeChat</a> and – especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me – you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/\">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which – through <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh\">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding – establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink\">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,\n  “AltitudeRef” : 0,\n  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,\n  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,\n  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,\n  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,\n  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,\n  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,\n  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,\n  “DOP” : 35\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature – which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world – comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>\n\n<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478\">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href=\"http://limechat.net/iphone/\">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> – as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat – was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"weechat-configuration\" id=\"weechat-configuration\">WeeChat Configuration</h4>\n\n<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~m455\">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>\n<ul><li><code>fset</code></li>\n<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>\n<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format \"%M\"</code></li></ul>\n\n<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/FhjqlFV1.png\" alt=\"Spacedust Chat-Minimal\"/></p>\n\n<p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157794243-413146bf-d004-4502-8ecd-b9bde2c10437.jpeg\" alt=\"Town TV\"/></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"town-television\" id=\"town-television\">Town Television</h2>\n\n<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020\">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png\" alt=\"Blink Appearance Settings\"/></p>\n\n<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window\">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png\" alt=\"Notifications in Blink\"/></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-considerations\" id=\"other-considerations\">Other Considerations</h2>\n\n<p>Blink has a URL scheme – <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&cmd=</code> – but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/\">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications – as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above – and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders – and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes – but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>\n\n<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about – the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown <a href=\"https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup\">here</a> and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bilge.world/tag:software\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">software</span></a> <a href=\"https://bilge.world/tag:configuration\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">configuration</span></a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/icons/blink.png\">Blink’s icon</a> is perhaps my most favorite of any application, ever.\n[2] Yes, that is my real location information and yes, I did include it intentionally. Please come kill me as soon as possible. Also, “DOR” is apparently an acronym for “<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_(navigation)\">Dilution of Precision</a>,” which is a mildly interesting measurement to read up on.\n[3] As <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307#issuecomment-1065429898\">the screenshots I captured suggest</a>, anyway. Obviously, I do not posess the means to test the true resolution display to mine eyes.</p>\n",

He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"2c71\" id=\"2c71\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"f295\" id=\"f295\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" data-href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a July article in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Barrons</em></a> quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading this year’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anchor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Megaphone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gimlet Media</a>, and — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most controversially</a> — the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property in the medium, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Joe Rogan Experience</em></a>. Though details of their implications are beyond the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume its concerns — if not its proposed solutions — should apply to the future of podcasting as well.</p>\n<h3 name=\"cfd7\" id=\"cfd7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Responsible Curation</h3>\n<p name=\"84f2\" id=\"84f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For solutions to address Spotify’s overwhelming skew toward rewarding popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that “<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half of Spotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly</a>.” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em>’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, all of his examples are male.</p>\n<p name=\"460b\" id=\"460b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fast Company</em> addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" data-href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify’s $30 billion playlist for global domination</a>:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"8068\" id=\"8068\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are eroding music’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"be10\" id=\"be10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook — the CEO of the most valuable company in the history of the world — as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy — vague, at best.</p>\n<figure name=\"60cb\" id=\"60cb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/At_K4FVY198?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"ed5d\" id=\"ed5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In <a href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" data-href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May</a>, Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists.</p>\n<p name=\"70ef\" id=\"70ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in <a href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" data-href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a 2008 interview with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The HTML Times</em></a>, creating an online presence for one’s music had long been “a pain in the ass:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"9646\" id=\"9646\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard.

This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company has repeatedly <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brought back the program</a> in recognition of its impact on independent artists, and the results have been profound.

In his interview, Dubber asks Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn’t get mentioned in all these press articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own business decisions out of “[his] personal preference:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"73c4\" id=\"73c4\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist promote themselves, and it’s not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.”</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"56ad\" id=\"56ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">As a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tastemaking</em> enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of Collections — which allow listeners to display music they’ve purchased on a customizable web page — and Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator’s Collection to those who follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">while helping artists earn $634 million</a> as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp’s success in response to a question from Dubber on the company’s comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis mine:)</p>\n<blockquote name=\"bf99\" id=\"bf99\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">\n<em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest part of the job because it’s whatever benefits artists the most.

He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"2c71\" id=\"2c71\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"f295\" id=\"f295\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" data-href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a July article in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Barrons</em></a> quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading this year’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anchor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Megaphone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gimlet Media</a>, and — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most controversially</a> — the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property in the medium, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Joe Rogan Experience</em></a>.

In 2015, the company claimed that “<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half of Spotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly</a>.” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em>’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, all of his examples are male.</p>\n<p name=\"460b\" id=\"460b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fast Company</em> addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" data-href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify’s $30 billion playlist for global domination</a>:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"8068\" id=\"8068\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are eroding music’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"be10\" id=\"be10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook — the CEO of the most valuable company in the history of the world — as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy — vague, at best.</p>\n<figure name=\"60cb\" id=\"60cb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/At_K4FVY198?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"ed5d\" id=\"ed5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In <a href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" data-href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May</a>, Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists.</p>\n<p name=\"70ef\" id=\"70ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians.

In his interview, Dubber asks Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn’t get mentioned in all these press articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own business decisions out of “[his] personal preference:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"73c4\" id=\"73c4\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist promote themselves, and it’s not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.”</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"56ad\" id=\"56ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">As a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tastemaking</em> enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of Collections — which allow listeners to display music they’ve purchased on a customizable web page — and Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator’s Collection to those who follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">while helping artists earn $634 million</a> as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp’s success in response to a question from Dubber on the company’s comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis mine:)</p>\n<blockquote name=\"bf99\" id=\"bf99\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">\n<em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest part of the job because it’s whatever benefits artists the most.

It would seem that all it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

Not that it’s particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in court</a>, essentially, that he didn’t know what the movie was about. I’m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the times</em>, but <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Social Dilemma</em> could’ve done better, in that regard.</p>\n<p name=\"711d\" id=\"711d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell’s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man’s screen, the film’s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">blatantly false</em> imagery. The Privacy Problem is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ridiculously</em> unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as “ridiculous,” as did one of my favs, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Casey Newton</a>:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"4541\" id=\"4541\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"2567\" id=\"2567\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Verge</em>’s official review of the film</a> — written by Adi Robinson and as cited by Casey — is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Verge</em>’s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">separate</em> tech media — grandmothers, retirees, etc. — who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Social Dilemma</em> and particularly susceptible to its delusions about “privacy” — a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">collection</strong> of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">examination</strong> with human eyes, which — while possible — is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.</p>\n<figure name=\"fff8\" id=\"fff8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1283173322822488064?s=20\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></figure><p name=\"0234\" id=\"0234\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now, on to the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">notably missing</strong>: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by — and directly promotes on several occasions — one particular organization, called the <a href=\"https://www.humanetech.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.humanetech.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Center for Humane Technology</em></a>, which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain… hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for “solutions” to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who’ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages — some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization’s website nor the film’s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>\n<figure name=\"ec06\" id=\"ec06\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\" data-width=\"1903\" data-height=\"937\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"e924\" id=\"e924\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> using them. What I’m here to tell you: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">you have a choice of services</strong>. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin.

Essentially, the evidence suggests that the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">alternatives</em> discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn’t immediately off-putting to “the average person.”</p>\n<figure name=\"0676\" id=\"0676\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://clyp.it/oxpup2vm/widget\" width=\"700\" height=\"258\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"0c40\" id=\"0c40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Poke around the film’s official website a bit and you’ll discover a variety of heavily-branded “resources” for “taking action,” all awash with a certain irony, including <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view\" data-href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a fucking Bingo game</a> (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">actually</em> suggests you post on your Instagram story!

Technically, suggesting you change your phone’s common name to that of “your favorite television character” (<a href=\"https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard\" data-href=\"https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hildur Odegard</a> is my favorite character in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fortitude</em>, so…) is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it’s just that it’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ridiculously</em> low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down “change device name” as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.</p>\n<figure name=\"b938\" id=\"b938\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*RpMyrNnS3-t9X8lI.jpeg\" data-width=\"1242\" data-height=\"332\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RpMyrNnS3-t9X8lI.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">A notification I received while literally typing this out.</em></figcaption></figure><p name=\"4127\" id=\"4127\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did</em> find an “<a href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/\" data-href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Apps Centre</a>” within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions.

I genuinely believe turning off <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all</em> notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I’d somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">years</em>, which is disturbing.

Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you’re an iOS user, you’ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step — if we’re really honest with ourselves — is figuring out how you’re going to go without the internet.

I’m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the times</em>, but <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Social Dilemma</em> could’ve done better, in that regard.</p>\n<p name=\"711d\" id=\"711d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell’s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man’s screen, the film’s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">blatantly false</em> imagery.

Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">collection</strong> of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">examination</strong> with human eyes, which — while possible — is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive.

Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who’ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages — some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization’s website nor the film’s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>\n<figure name=\"ec06\" id=\"ec06\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\" data-width=\"1903\" data-height=\"937\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"e924\" id=\"e924\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> using them.

Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you’re an iOS user, you’ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step — if we’re really honest with ourselves — is figuring out how you’re going to go without the internet.

Most any electronic music can be transportive and my own affection for it can no doubt be attributed at least in part to my near-total isolation from its community. I have never been to a proper <em>club</em> (the only offering in the setting of my young adulthood has never aspired beyond squishy DJs who are now somehow 100% content describing their scene as &ldquo;EDM,&quot;) and I&rsquo;ve only had a few friends with whom I could share significant interest, though their knowledge was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/MqgJFt7A010\">extraordinarily extensive</a>. It takes incisive wisdom to cut through &ldquo;Techno&rdquo; as the misnomer it has become in today&rsquo;s America - a subject deserving its own, more deliberate discussion - but for the moment, let&rsquo;s consider a single record which manages to exemplify the potential of this historically-niche medium.</p>\n<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been one hundred percent sure that &ldquo;Vril&rdquo; is a proper noun, but I could very well have gone on living the rest of my life never deciding between <em>whom</em> or <em>where</em>. Up until <em>Anima Mundi</em>&rsquo;s release on October 15th (technically it was released last year, but <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Vril-Anima-Mundi/release/9924870\">exclusively on cassette</a>,) his catalog was consistently <em>Vril</em> - on-brand, you might say - though in the most respectable sense for a dance DJ, I&rsquo;d imagine. I can&rsquo;t quite recall the moment of discovery, but I do know that the dozen or so of his live mixes available on Mixcloud caught my attention immediately afterward. There&rsquo;s something magic in the layers that grabs an unnamed rhythmic organ of mine in a way that cannot be expressed in written form without experience I do not have. What I <em>can</em> provide is the most comprehensively concise example I can find: a live set from the infamous Berghain in 2014.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163653482&color=%23141f35&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/inverted-audio\" title=\"INVERTED AUDIO\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">INVERTED AUDIO</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/inverted-audio/ia-mix-146-vril\" title=\"IA MIX 146 Vril\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">IA MIX 146 Vril</a></div>\n<p>Regardless if I&rsquo;m writing, walking(?,) or chasing gravel apexes, these mixes always kick me into another plane, where the panning high hat halos are biased astray by a fraction of a degree, delaying a false local disorientation akin to the sound of a dozen choreographed kindergarten tap dancers' feet next to one&rsquo;s head, mildly duration-compressed. Techno as a whole has become quite comfortable with the practice of orbiting high frequency percussion in elongated ellipses around the stereo picture, which I&rsquo;ve adored and defended since day 1. My hypotheses: it&rsquo;s actually a cheap shot for the psyche&rsquo;s potential desire for justification of their club experience as something transcendent. It&rsquo;s a pretty easy cheat to keep the listener&rsquo;s immediate environment feeling expansive, reflective, and therefore <em>meaningful</em>. I, myself am probably drawn to its threatening aura of <em>imminent contiguous industrial emergency</em>, but again, I&rsquo;ve never been to Berghain, London, or Stockholm, nor has my adult nightime recreation ever found me in any venue to which one could attribute the term &ldquo;club&rdquo; without immediately ``chuckling. This music has not traditionally found its place among lives like mine, and nobody even seems interested in figuring out why.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"IA MIX 146 Vril - Inverted Audio\" data-author=\"Konstantin\" cite=\"https://inverted-audio.com/mix/vril/\">\nIt seems like there was a big thirst for these kinds of intentions.

Let&rsquo;s have faith in Gavin and assume that he doesn&rsquo;t need perspective-altering narcotics to be introspective, but we&rsquo;ll wait until he&rsquo;s alone in his shitty dorm in the early morning hours, typing out an American History essay on his MacBook. He&rsquo;s in his bed, earbud-equipped noggin propped uncomfortably against the wall, machine resting on his diaphragm. It&rsquo;s streaming fucking Aphex Twin from some stranger&rsquo;s Spotify playlist, which we&rsquo;ve hacked. Just after &ldquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/i/281953327\">Windowlicker</a>&quot;&rsquo;s last, foul moan, we&rsquo;ll covertly begin this involuntary acquaintance with &ldquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1436866071\">Manium</a>&quot;&rsquo;s simple fade-in.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s sincerely serious, contemplative, science fiction-esque, but certainly not even as <em>manic</em> as the tasteless breast-obsessed number one hit he&rsquo;s just heard. In fact, the contrast is so sharp that his attention is agitated away from his sentence, and he looks off the screen across the room to the door&rsquo;s electronic knob. According to whomever wrote <a href=\"https://www.delsinrecords.com/release/6086/vril/anima-mundi\">Delsin&rsquo;s description</a> of the album, Gavin has just unwittingly set upon &ldquo;a deep excursion for mind and body&rdquo; - a phrase which would no doubt make him a bit uncomfortable, yet here, alone, or perhaps in the back seat of the right friend&rsquo;s car on a long drive, its acute caution compels his mind to consider the heaviest possible question of the moment: something about <em>finals</em>, I would guess. His brow slowly scrunches in the Word document&rsquo;s soft white glow. The unchanging dissonance from the background synth&rsquo;s single chord grows louder and louder, gradually, before dropping briskly, allowing for the similar successive fade-in of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1436866072\">Statera Rerum</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Layer number one is surely a four-second sample of a dot matrix printer&rsquo;s operation, slowed and pitched-down thirty or so percent - reminiscent of the phenomena to which shopping cart castors are commonly subject: a certain speed&rsquo;s vibration triggers a sort of resonant buzzing  freakout. Vril&rsquo;s simplistic construction continues with another mechanical layer, then panned pulsar synths which ebb and recede in lazier loops across the spectrum. By now, Gavin is on his way back to reality and has finally begun alt-tabbing by the last few seconds of track 2. Just as he finds and restores his Spotify window, it has ended, and the album&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://song.link/i/1436866073\">title track</a> begins. His investigation is stymied for a beat by the identical track and album metadata, but he&rsquo;s still curious enough to search the album out after figuring it out. Since this is a hypothetical world, let&rsquo;s make it just a bit better and assume <em>Anima Mundi</em>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://vrildelsin.bandcamp.com/album/anima-mundi\">Bandcamp page</a> is the first result returned by Gavin&rsquo;s search engine with its brief, but gorgeous motion graphic <a href=\"https://fb.watch/vudt2Piez6/?\">promo video</a>, which he allows to play parallel with track 3 on Spotify since it&rsquo;s less than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>The resulting cacophony is unlike anything he has ever heard, and - probably in reaction to his essay topic&rsquo;s inability to stimulate him whatsoever - its somewhat extended battle cry elicits sufficient intrigue to keep his attention from straying further. It&rsquo;s a lucky thing, too, because the rework of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1436866074\">Riese</a>&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/riese\">giant</a>&quot;) is up next, and it&rsquo;s the most profound and unexpected groove on the whole record. It&rsquo;s rhythmless, reflective, and <em>very</em> cinematic in a similar (but far <em>far</em> superior) doctrine to Hans Zimmer&rsquo;s use of simplistic, swelling harmonious chords to blast audiences' emotional intelligence to smithereens behind films like Michael Bay&rsquo;s <em>Pearl Harbor</em> and J.J. Abrams' <em>Star Trek</em>. According to <em>Inverted Audio</em>&rsquo;s review, its notes &ldquo;<a href=\"https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/\">lose their dissociative feeling for something a bit more intimate and in turn gain even more emotional power over the listener</a>.&rdquo; Essentially, it&rsquo;s real gorgeous, though Gavin&rsquo;s not quite in a vulnerable enough state to be moved to tears. So far, <em>Anima Mundi</em> has been almost entirely separate from &ldquo;techno&rdquo; as it is commonly defined, but it&rsquo;s clear to even the most casual fan of the scene that <strong>it&rsquo;s definitely an addendum, not abandonment</strong>. I could be wrong, but as a fan of Vril&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve found the four tracks Gavin&rsquo;s heard up to this point feel almost like the endnotes to the more brisk, purposeful melodic and rhythmic identities formed in <em><a href=\"https://song.link/album/i/957894188\">Portal</a></em>, his first album, along his years of live club arrangements. If I were to be a bit bold, I&rsquo;d surmise that Vril could consider <em>Anima Muni</em> an artistic declaration: <em>just so you know, I am a lot more than just the guy behind the booth - I am a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi\">world soul</a>.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it would be dishonest of me to extract a happy ending from my derriere for this hypothetical of ours because of a single word in track 5&rsquo;s title with truly awesome power among the Youth of Today: <em><strong>anime</strong></em>. In Spring 2017, I recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ijDWUrHaHVE\"><em>Futureland</em>&rsquo;s most entertaining episode with my good friend Tevin</a>, who happens to be a beautiful bridge between fraternity culture and Japanese Animated Video Content, yet lacks faith in the former&rsquo;s chances of progressing much at all, going forward. Gavin has probably been exposed to anime once or twice, but for him, it&rsquo;s unlikely to ever become anything but a punchline. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1436866075\">Infinitum Eternis Anime</a>&rdquo; means (roughly) &ldquo;infinite eternal soul,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the record&rsquo;s first amalgam of recognizably <em>techno</em> elements (for which I do not know any of the industry/jargon terms, so do forgive my lack of detail.) It&rsquo;s a shame Gavin won&rsquo;t give it a chance because it&rsquo;d likely serve as an effective gateway drug for a more sophisticated nightlife, but I&rsquo;m sure you were getting awfully tired of him, anyway. To cite <em>Inverted Audio</em>&rsquo;s Will Long once more:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Review: Vril: Anima Mundi - Inverted Audio\" data-author=\"Will Long\" cite=\"https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/\">\nEach one of the tracks from the ‘<em>Haus’</em> EP works even better in the context of the full record. “<em>Haus</em>” gets an even smoother, more melodic rework; “<em>Riese</em>” is also more melodic in construction with the beat stripped away in favour of more reverb and sustained notes.

				"content_text": "[![Anima Mundi Art](https://davidblue.blog/uploads/2024/animamundi.png)](https://vrilofficial.bandcamp.com/album/anima-mundi)\n\n## With *Anima Mundi*, Vril departs from his Berghain roots and delivers an introspective exploration of his eternal soul.\n\nIf I'm allowed to have favorites, I would claim Vril, the German DJ and Resident Advisor Lieutenant, as mine among his genre, which shouldn't mean anything to the longtime techno connoisseur (who should probably find themselves skipping this review and moving on,) but *does* lend me to evangelize to those who've been deprived of positive exposure to the culture. Most any electronic music can be transportive and my own affection for it can no doubt be attributed at least in part to my near-total isolation from its community. I have never been to a proper *club* (the only offering in the setting of my young adulthood has never aspired beyond squishy DJs who are now somehow 100% content describing their scene as \"EDM,\") and I've only had a few friends with whom I could share significant interest, though their knowledge was [extraordinarily extensive](https://www.youtube.com/live/MqgJFt7A010). It takes incisive wisdom to cut through \"Techno\" as the misnomer it has become in today's America - a subject deserving its own, more deliberate discussion - but for the moment, let's consider a single record which manages to exemplify the potential of this historically-niche medium.\n\nFor years, I've been one hundred percent sure that \"Vril\" is a proper noun, but I could very well have gone on living the rest of my life never deciding between *whom* or *where*. Up until *Anima Mundi*'s release on October 15th (technically it was released last year, but [exclusively on cassette](https://www.discogs.com/Vril-Anima-Mundi/release/9924870),) his catalog was consistently *Vril* - on-brand, you might say - though in the most respectable sense for a dance DJ, I'd imagine. I can't quite recall the moment of discovery, but I do know that the dozen or so of his live mixes available on Mixcloud caught my attention immediately afterward. There's something magic in the layers that grabs an unnamed rhythmic organ of mine in a way that cannot be expressed in written form without experience I do not have. What I *can* provide is the most comprehensively concise example I can find: a live set from the infamous Berghain in 2014. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163653482&color=%23141f35&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/inverted-audio\" title=\"INVERTED AUDIO\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">INVERTED AUDIO</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/inverted-audio/ia-mix-146-vril\" title=\"IA MIX 146 Vril\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">IA MIX 146 Vril</a></div>\n\nRegardless if I'm writing, walking(?,) or chasing gravel apexes, these mixes always kick me into another plane, where the panning high hat halos are biased astray by a fraction of a degree, delaying a false local disorientation akin to the sound of a dozen choreographed kindergarten tap dancers' feet next to one's head, mildly duration-compressed. Techno as a whole has become quite comfortable with the practice of orbiting high frequency percussion in elongated ellipses around the stereo picture, which I've adored and defended since day 1. My hypotheses: it's actually a cheap shot for the psyche's potential desire for justification of their club experience as something transcendent. It's a pretty easy cheat to keep the listener's immediate environment feeling expansive, reflective, and therefore *meaningful*. I, myself am probably drawn to its threatening aura of *imminent contiguous industrial emergency*, but again, I've never been to Berghain, London, or Stockholm, nor has my adult nightime recreation ever found me in any venue to which one could attribute the term \"club\" without immediately ``chuckling. This music has not traditionally found its place among lives like mine, and nobody even seems interested in figuring out why.\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"IA MIX 146 Vril - Inverted Audio\" data-author=\"Konstantin\" cite=\"https://inverted-audio.com/mix/vril/\">\nIt seems like there was a big thirst for these kinds of intentions.

Let's have faith in Gavin and assume that he doesn't need perspective-altering narcotics to be introspective, but we'll wait until he's alone in his shitty dorm in the early morning hours, typing out an American History essay on his MacBook. He's in his bed, earbud-equipped noggin propped uncomfortably against the wall, machine resting on his diaphragm. It's streaming fucking Aphex Twin from some stranger's Spotify playlist, which we've hacked. Just after \"[Windowlicker](https://song.link/i/281953327)\"'s last, foul moan, we'll covertly begin this involuntary acquaintance with \"[Manium](https://song.link/us/i/1436866071)\"'s simple fade-in.\n\nIt's sincerely serious, contemplative, science fiction-esque, but certainly not even as *manic* as the tasteless breast-obsessed number one hit he's just heard. In fact, the contrast is so sharp that his attention is agitated away from his sentence, and he looks off the screen across the room to the door's electronic knob. According to whomever wrote [Delsin's description](https://www.delsinrecords.com/release/6086/vril/anima-mundi) of the album, Gavin has just unwittingly set upon \"a deep excursion for mind and body\" - a phrase which would no doubt make him a bit uncomfortable, yet here, alone, or perhaps in the back seat of the right friend's car on a long drive, its acute caution compels his mind to consider the heaviest possible question of the moment: something about *finals*, I would guess. His brow slowly scrunches in the Word document's soft white glow. The unchanging dissonance from the background synth's single chord grows louder and louder, gradually, before dropping briskly, allowing for the similar successive fade-in of \"[Statera Rerum](https://song.link/us/i/1436866072).\"\n\nLayer number one is surely a four-second sample of a dot matrix printer's operation, slowed and pitched-down thirty or so percent - reminiscent of the phenomena to which shopping cart castors are commonly subject: a certain speed's vibration triggers a sort of resonant buzzing  freakout. Vril's simplistic construction continues with another mechanical layer, then panned pulsar synths which ebb and recede in lazier loops across the spectrum. By now, Gavin is on his way back to reality and has finally begun alt-tabbing by the last few seconds of track 2. Just as he finds and restores his Spotify window, it has ended, and the album's [title track](https://song.link/i/1436866073) begins. His investigation is stymied for a beat by the identical track and album metadata, but he's still curious enough to search the album out after figuring it out. Since this is a hypothetical world, let's make it just a bit better and assume *Anima Mundi*'s [Bandcamp page](https://vrildelsin.bandcamp.com/album/anima-mundi) is the first result returned by Gavin's search engine with its brief, but gorgeous motion graphic [promo video](https://fb.watch/vudt2Piez6/?), which he allows to play parallel with track 3 on Spotify since it's less than 30 seconds.\n\nThe resulting cacophony is unlike anything he has ever heard, and - probably in reaction to his essay topic's inability to stimulate him whatsoever - its somewhat extended battle cry elicits sufficient intrigue to keep his attention from straying further. It's a lucky thing, too, because the rework of \"[Riese](https://song.link/us/i/1436866074)\" (literally \"[giant](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/riese)\") is up next, and it's the most profound and unexpected groove on the whole record. It's rhythmless, reflective, and *very* cinematic in a similar (but far *far* superior) doctrine to Hans Zimmer's use of simplistic, swelling harmonious chords to blast audiences' emotional intelligence to smithereens behind films like Michael Bay's *Pearl Harbor* and J.J. Abrams' *Star Trek*. According to *Inverted Audio*'s review, its notes \"[lose their dissociative feeling for something a bit more intimate and in turn gain even more emotional power over the listener](https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/).\" Essentially, it's real gorgeous, though Gavin's not quite in a vulnerable enough state to be moved to tears. So far, *Anima Mundi* has been almost entirely separate from \"techno\" as it is commonly defined, but it's clear to even the most casual fan of the scene that **it's definitely an addendum, not abandonment**. I could be wrong, but as a fan of Vril's, I've found the four tracks Gavin's heard up to this point feel almost like the endnotes to the more brisk, purposeful melodic and rhythmic identities formed in *[Portal](https://song.link/album/i/957894188)*, his first album, along his years of live club arrangements. If I were to be a bit bold, I'd surmise that Vril could consider *Anima Muni* an artistic declaration: *just so you know, I am a lot more than just the guy behind the booth - I am a \"[world soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi).\"*\n\nI'm afraid it would be dishonest of me to extract a happy ending from my derriere for this hypothetical of ours because of a single word in track 5's title with truly awesome power among the Youth of Today: ***anime***. In Spring 2017, I recorded [*Futureland*'s most entertaining episode with my good friend Tevin](https://www.youtube.com/live/ijDWUrHaHVE), who happens to be a beautiful bridge between fraternity culture and Japanese Animated Video Content, yet lacks faith in the former's chances of progressing much at all, going forward. Gavin has probably been exposed to anime once or twice, but for him, it's unlikely to ever become anything but a punchline. \"[Infinitum Eternis Anime](https://song.link/us/i/1436866075)\" means (roughly) \"infinite eternal soul,\" and it's the record's first amalgam of recognizably *techno* elements (for which I do not know any of the industry/jargon terms, so do forgive my lack of detail.) It's a shame Gavin won't give it a chance because it'd likely serve as an effective gateway drug for a more sophisticated nightlife, but I'm sure you were getting awfully tired of him, anyway. To cite *Inverted Audio*'s Will Long once more:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Review: Vril: Anima Mundi - Inverted Audio\" data-author=\"Will Long\" cite=\"https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/\">\nEach one of the tracks from the ‘<em>Haus’</em> EP works even better in the context of the full record. “<em>Haus</em>” gets an even smoother, more melodic rework; “<em>Riese</em>” is also more melodic in construction with the beat stripped away in favour of more reverb and sustained notes. They lose their dissociative feeling for something a bit more intimate and in turn gain even more emotional power over the listener.\n<footer>Will Long<cite> <a href=\"https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/\">https://inverted-audio.com/review/vril-anima-mundi/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nThough his comparison of *Anima Mundi* to Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey* was quite crude, I can obviously concur with some of his other language, like \"future classic,\" and \"buy on sight.\" As much as I'd like to further indulge my own analysis of the rest of the 80 minute work's tracks, one-by-one, let me just conclude by doting on my personal favorite track, \"[Sine Fine](https://song.link/us/i/1436866081).\" Without resorting to the word \"ambiance,\" I can't say much, but - above all - it's Track 10 that takes me to *The Vril Place* in which I have always felt so intrigued and comfortable.

I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and </em>thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">named</em> unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" data-href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">memorize the entire screenplay</a> and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”</p>\n<p name=\"150c\" id=\"150c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad</em> could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I Am Legend </em>if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself <a href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" data-href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described </a>it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">National Treasure</em>, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad. </em>Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.</p>\n<p name=\"972d\" id=\"972d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">This <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fun </em>thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Winchester </em>(just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad </em>does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”</p>\n</div></div>\n",

One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad</em>. If you want to judge Academically the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">effectiveness </em>of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Skyfall</em>,) you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">must</em> give the little golden man to these folks, whoever they are.</p>\n<figure name=\"c86f\" id=\"c86f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5462326/\" data-href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5462326/\" class=\"graf-imageAnchor\" data-action=\"image-link\" data-action-observe-only=\"true\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*8T8lIU6bKouCrK1PAP82Yg.png\" data-width=\"1748\" data-height=\"762\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8T8lIU6bKouCrK1PAP82Yg.png\"></a></figure><p name=\"8596\" id=\"8596\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When’s the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental pair on a big screen? I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and </em>thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">named</em> unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" data-href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">memorize the entire screenplay</a> and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”</p>\n<p name=\"150c\" id=\"150c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad</em> could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I Am Legend </em>if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself <a href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" data-href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described </a>it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">National Treasure</em>, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad. </em>Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.</p>\n<p name=\"972d\" id=\"972d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">This <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fun </em>thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Winchester </em>(just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad </em>does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”</p>\n</div></div>\n",
