One commonly used command is <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code>. You can run the following command in your macOS terminal:</p>\n<pre name=\"de4a\" id=\"de4a\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">top -l 1 | grep \"CPU usage\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"d427\" id=\"d427\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will provide a one-time snapshot of CPU usage. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">-l 1</code> option tells <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> to only run once, and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">grep \"CPU usage\"</code> filters the relevant lines to display CPU usage information.</p>\n<p name=\"4af0\" id=\"4af0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you want continuous monitoring, you can run <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> without <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">-l 1</code> to see real-time updates. Press <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">q</code> to exit <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> when you're done.</p>\n<p name=\"a6c4\" id=\"a6c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can also use specific utilities like <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">htop</code> or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">iStat Menus</code> if you want a more detailed and interactive performance monitoring tool.</p>\n<p name=\"4f0b\" id=\"4f0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Feel free to ask for more details or other performance metrics you’d like to monitor.</p>\n<h4 name=\"4fb9\" id=\"4fb9\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"1d96\" id=\"1d96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Okay, when I ran your snippet, here is the result I got:</p>\n<p name=\"8833\" id=\"8833\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">CPU usage: 5.17% user, 12.93% sys, 81.89% idle</code></p>\n<p name=\"6722\" id=\"6722\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How would I get the combined CPU usage as a percentage value without the labels?</p>\n<h4 name=\"b9fa\" id=\"b9fa\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"15ba\" id=\"15ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To extract the combined CPU usage as a percentage value without the labels, you can use the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command to parse the output from <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code>. Here's how you can modify the command:</p>\n<pre name=\"040d\" id=\"040d\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/CPU usage/ {print $7}'</code></pre>\n<p name=\"06bf\" id=\"06bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will display the combined CPU usage as a percentage value. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command looks for lines containing \"CPU usage\" and prints the 7th column, which is the combined CPU usage percentage.</p>\n<p name=\"2734\" id=\"2734\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you want to calculate and display only the total CPU usage percentage without the labels, this command will do the job for you.</p>\n<h4 name=\"137d\" id=\"137d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"b2e1\" id=\"b2e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">That’s perfect!</p>\n<p name=\"1fba\" id=\"1fba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I’m trying to do is come up with a one-line command to populate values of a widget in the Secure ShellFish app.</p>\n<p name=\"ef35\" id=\"ef35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How would I embed your snippet in the following command so that the output percentage value would replace “PLACEBOLDER”?</p>\n<p name=\"f938\" id=\"f938\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget cpu.fill PLACEHOLDER CPU</code></p>\n<h4 name=\"b34a\" id=\"b34a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"ef4b\" id=\"ef4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To embed the snippet into the command and replace “PLACEHOLDER” with the CPU usage percentage, you can use command substitution.

Here's how you can modify the command to achieve this:</p>\n<pre name=\"75d4\" id=\"75d4\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print $8}') memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"77cc\" id=\"77cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will run the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top</code> command to retrieve the percentage of physical memory used and then use it to replace \"PLACEHOLDER\" in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget memory.fill</code> command. The <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">awk</code> command extracts the memory usage percentage, which is in the 8th column of the output.</p>\n<h4 name=\"7b4d\" id=\"7b4d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"1086\" id=\"1086\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">When running the following snippet, I seem to be getting an empty value:</p>\n<p name=\"8203\" id=\"8203\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ \\{print $8}'</code></p>\n<p name=\"ba65\" id=\"ba65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But running the following snippet:</p>\n<p name=\"1a25\" id=\"1a25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/'</code></p>\n<p name=\"f839\" id=\"f839\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Returned this value:</p>\n<p name=\"de95\" id=\"de95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">PhysMem: 15G used (1755M wired), 1328M unused.</code></p>\n<p name=\"889e\" id=\"889e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, I’m assuming there needs to be additional manipulation of the output above to convert it into percentage of PhysMem currently used. How would I do that?</p>\n<h4 name=\"2a6e\" id=\"2a6e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"68b6\" id=\"68b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You’re correct; you need to perform additional manipulation to convert the memory usage into a percentage value. Here’s how you can modify the command to achieve that:</p>\n<pre name=\"29bc\" id=\"29bc\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print int(($8 / $2) * 100)}')% memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"b5e2\" id=\"b5e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">In this updated command, we use <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">int(($8 / $2) * 100)</code> to calculate the percentage of physical memory used. It divides the amount used (8th column) by the total physical memory (2nd column) and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage. The result is then appended with \"% memory used\" and used to replace \"PLACEHOLDER\" in the <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">widget memory.fill</code> command.</p>\n<p name=\"30d2\" id=\"30d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This should provide you with the percentage of physical memory currently used.</p>\n<h4 name=\"ee2c\" id=\"ee2c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">You:</h4>\n<p name=\"bfc5\" id=\"bfc5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">That snippet is returning a value of 0, which does not reflect the actual percent memory used value.</p>\n<h4 name=\"ac63\" id=\"ac63\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">ChatGPT:</h4>\n<p name=\"d1e7\" id=\"d1e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I apologize for the incorrect command earlier. To calculate the percentage of memory used accurately, you can use the following command:</p>\n<pre name=\"e8dc\" id=\"e8dc\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">widget memory.fill \"$(top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {used = $8; total = $2; sub(/M/, \"\", used); sub(/G/, \"000M\", total); print int(used / total * 100)}')% memory used\"</code></pre>\n<p name=\"cbce\" id=\"cbce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">This command will correctly calculate the percentage of physical memory used by converting both used and total memory to a common unit (in this case, megabytes) and then calculating the percentage.

The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.</p>\n<p name=\"2a96\" id=\"2a96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.</p>\n<p name=\"1e22\" id=\"1e22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now</em> is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences on the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?</p>\n<p name=\"a8a8\" id=\"a8a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.</p>\n<p name=\"8b99\" id=\"8b99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My father’s experiences between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">his</em> farm, using the exact same equipment.</p>\n<p name=\"a776\" id=\"a776\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT television, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to anything they found inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married and farmed in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.</p>\n<p name=\"df4d\" id=\"df4d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would build the part of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver had sat without running for two long, and I would pee in a chamber pot in order to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down the attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.</p>\n<p name=\"d4f3\" id=\"d4f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to take up the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">extremely</em> fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not an emotional or particularly involved one. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.</p>\n<p name=\"6b73\" id=\"6b73\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did </em>have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A Bug’s Life</em> to wander around its first level. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.</p>\n<p name=\"a0e7\" id=\"a0e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Modern Marvels</em> on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This one program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.</p>\n<p name=\"7abf\" id=\"7abf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked and my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a big iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.</p>\n<p name=\"96dd\" id=\"96dd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 9th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.</p>\n<p name=\"4d3c\" id=\"4d3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro and first exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadgets and experiment with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.</p>\n<p name=\"084f\" id=\"084f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the enduser in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Gizmodo</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Engadget</em> made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it was happening throughout my last few years before adulthood when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.</p>\n<p name=\"e138\" id=\"e138\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The story of consumer technology since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new types of products that have little defensible place in a linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly an escapist industry which has yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">remove</em> obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">contribute</em> to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.</p>\n<p name=\"fb86\" id=\"fb86\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both what we should be doing and what we should be seeking to learn to do with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.</p>\n<p name=\"859b\" id=\"859b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch having experienced an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> really want from the times you are living.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cheesy</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">stubborn</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dweebish</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pious</em>, or just generally <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">boring</em>, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ponder</em> for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">selling good</strong> <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">music</strong>.</p>\n<p name=\"7ba1\" id=\"7ba1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in — <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">significantly less</a> than other channels; <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">half</em> what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.</p>\n<figure name=\"efdb\" id=\"efdb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F308609407&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"700\" height=\"145\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"c43a\" id=\"c43a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Face The Music 2016</em> in Melbourne — as far as one can possibly get from The Valley — alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Jervis</a> to observe his interview for a live audience.</p>\n<p name=\"1eb4\" id=\"1eb4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically.

We haven’t really tooted our horn very hard.</p>\n<p name=\"9145\" id=\"9145\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype which the global End User community at large are presently discovering at twice the speed of sound there should <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">at least</em> be some conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">any</em> sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.</p>\n<p name=\"301d\" id=\"301d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM</a></p>\n<p name=\"2584\" id=\"2584\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethans</a> go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a> at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language.</p>\n<p name=\"25a5\" id=\"25a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company’s existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.</p>\n<p name=\"610c\" id=\"610c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough to stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx\" data-href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emotionally-charged</a> Innovation Myth, now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relinquished almost entirely</a> to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame — only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.</p>\n<p name=\"593c\" id=\"593c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”</p>\n<p name=\"ea8d\" id=\"ea8d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.</p>\n<figure name=\"fd99\" id=\"fd99\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3931299777/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><h3 name=\"405d\" id=\"405d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">On The Web</h3>\n<p name=\"cf16\" id=\"cf16\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/\" data-href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes Radio</a> that was absorbed into — and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">restricted to subscribers of</a> — Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” — along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) — are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “<a href=\"http://extratone.com/library/internetradiopatent-jozsefkirally.pdf\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/library/internetradiopatent-jozsefkirally.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Radio</a>.” Astonishingly, the protocol — still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt — has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations.</p>\n<p name=\"d187\" id=\"d187\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Ironically, the <a href=\"http://radio.garden/\" data-href=\"http://radio.garden/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">majority</a> of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US\" data-href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s dated support page</a> for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network <a href=\"http://extratone.com/library/voa.pdf\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/library/voa.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Voice of America</a> became the “[First <a href=\"http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html\" data-href=\"http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">radio] on the Internet</a>” when it <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ\" data-href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">began</a> — after <a href=\"http://extratone.com/media/voagore.mp3\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/media/voagore.mp3\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an introduction by Al Gore</a>, no less — “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However — since we’re already this deep into internet history — a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server — in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke.</p>\n<p name=\"cf98\" id=\"cf98\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio.

Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most <a href=\"http://extratone.com/library/diffusionofinnovations-everettmrogers.pdf\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/library/diffusionofinnovations-everettmrogers.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">laggard laggards</a>. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.</p>\n<p name=\"d49f\" id=\"d49f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Crucially, the truly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">most</em> critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance\" data-href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings</a>” for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Linux Journal</em> in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “<a href=\"https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218\" data-href=\"https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air</a>?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this was no Cambridge Analytica</em>: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">four years</em> back — the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”</p>\n<p name=\"f283\" id=\"f283\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations’ primary market relationship isn’t with advertisers; it’s with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don’t need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks they’ve made a payment.</p>\n<p name=\"071a\" id=\"071a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations\" data-href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March, 2010</a>, just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’s origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.</p>\n<p name=\"0dbb\" id=\"0dbb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’ve sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are <a href=\"http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off\" data-href=\"http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy</a> to feel sustainable.

As Holt laments in <a href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" data-href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with </a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The HTML Times</em>, creating an online presence for your music had long been “a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p name=\"07c9\" id=\"07c9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard.

The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond — who’s more or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning — began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first post on the Bandcamp blog</a>, explaining the solutions the team had come up with in greater detail.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"9f69\" id=\"9f69\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review.

Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player.</p>\n<figure name=\"630f\" id=\"630f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1739268?app_id=122963\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"a00e\" id=\"a00e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Study <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1739268\" data-href=\"https://vimeo.com/1739268\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Diamond’s first “screencast”</a> alongside a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1857085\" data-href=\"https://vimeo.com/1857085\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video tour of SoundCloud</a> from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dignified</em> Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this one platform</em>, which knew <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">exactly</em> what it was from birth, along with what it would <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">always</em> be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience — none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases — before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">nothing</em> of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">custom page design</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">email address capture</a>, and <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support for custom domains</a>.

Suffice it to say, the two founders’ visions differ greatly.</p>\n<figure name=\"e725\" id=\"e725\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2699072912/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><h3 name=\"b02b\" id=\"b02b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Musicblogocide</h3>\n<p name=\"afcf\" id=\"afcf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Contextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">check it out</em> sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography — like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Illmatic</em>, for instance — was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.</p>\n<p name=\"0b38\" id=\"0b38\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">visible</em> Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) <a href=\"https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html\" data-href=\"https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deleted six music blogs</a> from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Registry</em> <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/\" data-href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insisted</a> the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself.</p>\n<p name=\"3437\" id=\"3437\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“It would seem the music bloggers aren’t versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can’t blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quoted in The Guardian</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"aec9\" id=\"aec9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“It’s just sad because we were documenting young people’s music from all around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn’t have been able to discover elsewhere.”</p>\n<p name=\"89a7\" id=\"89a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA’s deftness, but that <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before deciding the law applied to them</strong>. It’d be a tad reckless to claim this little act of Google Cruelty to be the beginning of</p>\n<p name=\"4e80\" id=\"4e80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes — it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access.</p>\n<p name=\"5469\" id=\"5469\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships</strong>, joining <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70 million others</a> globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack — at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations… or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify — even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there — because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular feature by <a href=\"http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/\" data-href=\"http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxie 500</a>’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety — <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em> — entitled “<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming</a>,” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics.</p>\n<p name=\"49c7\" id=\"49c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks</strong> [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.”</p>\n<p name=\"be6c\" id=\"be6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Why?

Last month, The Carters released an album on which <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616\" data-href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">even Beyoncé</a> identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ’cause my success can’t be quantified,” she rapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify.” The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime (and probably far beyond.)</p>\n<p name=\"c7ca\" id=\"c7ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">she owes for her career’s creation</a> in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subject at a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]</p>\n<p name=\"7d6f\" id=\"7d6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digits themselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they <a href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/\" data-href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched a WordPress blog</a> dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their data called <a href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/\" data-href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Spotify Insights</em></a>, proclaiming themselves — naturally — to be “the world’s favorite streaming service,” <a href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/\" data-href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">championing</a> the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twice upon a <a href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce\" data-href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">search of its archive</a> as it stands today, it’s with fanfare: “<a href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/\" data-href=\"https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify</a>” declared her the third most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)</p>\n<figure name=\"906f\" id=\"906f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1880328200/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"1ec1\" id=\"1ec1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d have your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively — and they can do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And — as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign — both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell — it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.</p>\n<p name=\"aefa\" id=\"aefa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development — its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in <a href=\"http://extratone.com/library/grousesoftheholy-gq.pdf\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/library/grousesoftheholy-gq.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Klosterman’s GQ interview</a> with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time” — <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Zinc Blimp</em> legend Jumbo Page.</p>\n<p name=\"48c8\" id=\"48c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd,” as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.</p>\n<p name=\"d523\" id=\"d523\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Bandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent — by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.</p>\n<p name=\"7e69\" id=\"7e69\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year, they released <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/\" data-href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">their first earnings report</a> in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services — <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">let’s use this cool new tech to play </em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">music</em></strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> for </em><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">anybody</em></strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast</em> — yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.</p>\n<p name=\"da42\" id=\"da42\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew — it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014] — we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company’s solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">digital interpretation of a music collection</strong>, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “<a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp for Fans</a>.” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery — they can be really really good for that,” Diamond <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">concedes</a>, before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”</p>\n<p name=\"a0b1\" id=\"a0b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only — never to stream it — and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July 2010</a>, actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">to this day</em>, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album</strong>, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then — 3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway — and then in 2013, <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Bandcamp app was launched</a> on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.</p>\n<p name=\"2cf3\" id=\"2cf3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I made a point to spend <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a lot</em> of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible — naturally, this included a trip back through <a href=\"http://bandcamp.com/davidblue\" data-href=\"http://bandcamp.com/davidblue\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my neglected, digitally dusty Collection</a>, which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">real favorites</em>, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album… I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful — not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of <a href=\"http://extratone.com/radio\" data-href=\"http://extratone.com/radio\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Extratone Radio</a> to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased — including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see — even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)</p>\n<figure name=\"207b\" id=\"207b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3541770920/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><h3 name=\"259a\" id=\"259a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">The Discovery Debacle</h3>\n<p name=\"257f\" id=\"257f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish — an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all — but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device — whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit — the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question?</p>\n<p name=\"13a7\" id=\"13a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.</p>\n<p name=\"2ef4\" id=\"2ef4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched — aided tremendously by my expert best friend — for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique</strong>. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking — eyes rolled back — and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety</strong> out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.</p>\n<p name=\"43d5\" id=\"43d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The real, sweetest truth is that <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">100% of all music has value potential</strong> because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”</p>\n<p name=\"f2dc\" id=\"f2dc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance — actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved — only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture</strong>, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock &amp; roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.</p>\n<p name=\"454b\" id=\"454b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys — generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER…” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about</p>\n<p name=\"5eec\" id=\"5eec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School.

You must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled 90s — S.E.T.I.’s glory days — when we felt pretty damned good about space.

Even the longest living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seems excessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music” because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world” again, in exchange.</p>\n<h3 name=\"0341\" id=\"0341\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Distribution &amp; Curation</h3>\n<p name=\"df81\" id=\"df81\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit</strong> and we’re going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your part because we are fucking saints.

You get on Facebook Messenger — no time to bother with the formality of creating an event — and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?</blockquote>\n<p name=\"df9b\" id=\"df9b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Let’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life — <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">of course</em> I realize this — and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate manifestation.</p>\n<p name=\"260b\" id=\"260b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I understand that it’s not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">always</em> time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’s most worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and — if you still find yourself unwilling to bother, even — carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what’s going on</em> in music with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s own subjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/or patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point — extreme or not — and you’re at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles — as I have — folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you. If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">real</em> reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp — perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all.</p>\n<p name=\"2604\" id=\"2604\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The “<a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Discoverinator</a>” (I would’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the</em> most ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least… It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to its recent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful — it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.)</p>\n<figure name=\"277f\" id=\"277f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOaEAR9Da70?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"328f\" id=\"328f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Front and center on the homepage is the <a href=\"http://daily.bandcamp.com/\" data-href=\"http://daily.bandcamp.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp Daily</a> — a showcase of features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’d most certainly judge befit of a standalone publication — and the <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/?show\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/?show\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp Weekly</a> — an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest appearances, and commentary which the company’s <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chief Curator Andrew Jervis</a> has been honing <a href=\"http://bandcamp.com/?show=1\" data-href=\"http://bandcamp.com/?show=1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">since 2013</a> over 289 episodes as of <a href=\"http://bandcamp.com/?show=289\" data-href=\"http://bandcamp.com/?show=289\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this morning</a>. Its player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’re actually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Bandcamp Weekly</em>’s.</p>\n<p name=\"9cc3\" id=\"9cc3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests — how viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’ll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the</em> most ridiculous sphere within which to intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Medium,</em>) so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative.</p>\n<p name=\"97a0\" id=\"97a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark — it can be configured to simply <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">keep going</em> after you’ve finished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of course) — but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free <a href=\"https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services\" data-href=\"https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Music service</a> has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">outside</em> in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.</p>\n<p name=\"5ae6\" id=\"5ae6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Startlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Internet radio</em>? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station — a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">student</em> radio station, even — but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So — forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment — why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire — necessary, really — when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">how about an option to filter out white rappers</strong>? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)</p>\n<figure name=\"f510\" id=\"f510\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2256266207/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"15b4\" id=\"15b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/\" data-href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly still nearly 25% larger</a>, its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did</em> know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dbapple\" data-href=\"http://bit.ly/dbapple\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my public profile</a> including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but — crucially, for myself — after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all</em> the music on iTunes proper.</p>\n<p name=\"a462\" id=\"a462\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While I might personally play Bandcamp Weekly episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery — the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”</p>\n<figure name=\"c44b\" id=\"c44b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=151662136/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"39a9\" id=\"39a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Ironically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em> openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly\" data-href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">100% essential analysis</a> of algorithmically-generated playlists for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Baffler</em> notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a <a href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/\" data-href=\"https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Webby Award-winning</a> advertorial series called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Inside Discovery</em>, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”</p>\n<p name=\"1d74\" id=\"1d74\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming — the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”</p>\n<p name=\"3e0e\" id=\"3e0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Inside Discovery</em>’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I wish business just incentived building nice things</em> disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on <a href=\"https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski\" data-href=\"https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitski’s playlist</a>, to whom I’d just been <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reintroduced</a> (by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em>, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em>.)</p>\n<p name=\"8557\" id=\"8557\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.</p>\n<p name=\"77fe\" id=\"77fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,” <a href=\"https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms\" data-href=\"https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opines somebody on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pigeons &amp; Planes</em></a>, complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist?</p>\n<p name=\"5c9c\" id=\"5c9c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share — the whole present-day reading world and I, that is — of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">wrong</em> everywhere else.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"8a55\" id=\"8a55\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands?

But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?</blockquote>\n</div></div>\n",

Here are some ways you can support her and take action against catcalling:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Validate her feelings: Let her know that you believe her and that her feelings of discomfort or frustration are valid.</li>\n<li>Encourage communication: Talk openly with her about how she feels and what actions she would like to take, ensuring she feels heard and supported.</li>\n<li>Accompany her: Offer to walk with her in downtown areas where she has experienced catcalling, as having a supportive presence can provide a sense of safety.</li>\n<li>Help her report incidents: If she feels comfortable doing so, assist her in reporting specific incidents of catcalling to local authorities or relevant organizations.</li>\n<li>Advocate for safe public spaces: Raise awareness about the issue of catcalling in your community and support efforts to create safe and respectful public spaces.</li>\n<li>Encourage self-defense training: If she&rsquo;s interested, consider encouraging her to take self-defense classes, which can provide her with valuable skills and confidence.</li>\n<li>Share resources: Provide her with information on organizations that support victims of street harassment, as they may offer guidance and assistance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, your role as a supportive partner is essential, but always respect her wishes and decisions on how to address the situation.

If you decide to have a conversation with the catcaller, consider the following tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stay calm and composed: Approach the situation with a level-headed demeanor to keep the conversation constructive and avoid escalating tensions.</li>\n<li>Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements: Frame your points from a personal perspective, expressing how catcalling affects your girlfriend and others around her, rather than placing blame or accusing the catcaller.</li>\n<li>Be assertive and respectful: Firmly state that catcalling is unacceptable behavior and can cause distress or fear to those on the receiving end.</li>\n<li>Educate on the impact: Explain the harmful effects of catcalling on individuals' mental and emotional well-being, emphasizing that respectful behavior is essential in public spaces.</li>\n<li>Appeal to empathy: Encourage the catcaller to imagine how they would feel if someone close to them were subjected to similar harassment.</li>\n<li>Ask questions: Engage the catcaller in a conversation to understand their perspective and reasons behind their actions. Sometimes, this can lead to self-reflection and awareness.</li>\n<li>Stay safe and disengage if necessary: If the person becomes defensive or hostile, prioritize your safety and exit the situation calmly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that while addressing the catcaller directly can be empowering, it might not always lead to immediate change.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p name=\"4c55\" id=\"4c55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">This essay seeks to examine the breadth of donor-funded, open source, federated social networks as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">technical</em> alternatives to commercial online environments like Facebook and Twitter as measured by their users’ overall satisfaction with them as means of social interactivity over time. Following recent debates and confusion regarding the ethics in the practices of the organizations which built them and the extent of their complicity in the radical cultural consequences of digital communication surrounding the United States’ Presidential Election in 2016, it proposes that greater rhetorical and legislative attention be invested in the tangible, documented design decisions across their products’ history as the most crucial, relevant, and effective means of understanding the whole context, within which it will define <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">open source software development</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">federated networking</em> in contrast to the guarded industry establishment which the dominant services have transitioned from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">disrupting</em> by design to entirely exemplifying thus far in the century. After examining conspicuous alterations and inexplicably silent feature additions and subtractions across the whole of social network development, as well as their eventual result’s reflections on the conscious satisfaction of individual Social Media users, it will conclude by profiling a select few communities thriving on donation-funded, collaboratively maintained, and/or decentralized platforms as superior foundations upon which citizens of the web might rebuild their own traumatized and fragmented networks when they are ready to begin again.</p>\n<h3 name=\"7d41\" id=\"7d41\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Introduction</h3>\n<p name=\"3310\" id=\"3310\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If we accept Electronic Mail as the absolute genesis of what we call “Social Media,” the term becomes inextricably linked with <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" data-href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-of-Social-Media-and-its-Impact-on-Edosomwan-Prakasan/3f00eb1fdb5086f48583f04da28363b9199401fd\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the history of the World Wide Web as a whole</a>. The technical protocol we know as Email is by nature “decentralized,” “distributed,” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> “federated” as the terms are used in this essay because it is technically unbeholden to any single transmission or client service — commercial or not — and it allows users to participate with any server installation they choose, up to and including personal email servers <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" data-href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/helm-email-server\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">installed in one’s home</a>. In this essay, “decentralized social networks,” “distributed social platforms,” and “federated social networking” fall together under the category of “open web technologies,” which are <a href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" data-href=\"http://www.openwebfoundation.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by definition non-proprietary</a>. This essay proceeds under the notable assumption that The Web as a whole “was, at its core and in its design, a democratizing technology,” and that its potential to be more “open” will remain limitless as long as its <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" data-href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental structure is at all recognizable as The Web</a>. In fact, using the adjectives “decentralized” and “distributed” in front of any web-native technologies could be considered oxymoronic, as The Web’s existence as an entity comprised of many interconnecting interconnections without any requisite central spaces or governing bodies remains technically unmolested, despite the encroaching would-be for-profit adjudicators Google and Facebook. (While the abrupt and total disappearance of either or both company’s total online proprietorship would be a massive event, the remainder of The Web would continue to function.)</p>\n<p name=\"b89f\" id=\"b89f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Email is undoubtedly a form of social <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">networking</em>, though it was the addition of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) — a parallel technology — that manifested what many scholars have offered as the first published media for the sake of socializing online. Four key pillars of Social Media services in their <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">current</em> form were arrived upon within an editorial issue <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" data-href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2647377\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduction for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Telecommunications Policy</em></a>:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li name=\"13ce\" id=\"13ce\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The software powering Social Media services are definitive “Web 2.0” properties, as platforms “for creating and publishing content, and also [places] where content can be ‘continuously modified by all users in a participatory and collaborative fashion.’”</li>\n<li name=\"d4cc\" id=\"d4cc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services are primarily driven by <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">User</em>-Generated Content.</li>\n<li name=\"f268\" id=\"f268\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services include a directorial functionality which enables users to create “profiles” to represent themselves.</li>\n<li name=\"9c58\" id=\"9c58\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Social Media services “facilitate the development of social networks” by the interconnection of user profiles as units.</li>\n</ol>\n<p name=\"5314\" id=\"5314\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In 1996, Poet, Grateful Dead ghostwriter, and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation John Perry Barlow published a manifesto entitled <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" data-href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em></a> which proves an insightful abstract into the most romanticized, principled, and abstractly ideological thought of that period surrounding The Web’s future.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"c50c\" id=\"c50c\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"eac7\" id=\"eac7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">From our retrospective, the bravado in Barlow’s declarations addressed specifically to “Governments of the Industrial World” presents an important contrast on which to reflect. Current events surrounding regulation of the tech industry reflect a general desire for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">more</em> government intervention from both mainstream political parties in the United States. As I write, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2020/nov/17/facebook-twitter-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-congress-latest-election-news\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an appearance by the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook</a> in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee has just concluded, during which both fielded questions from senators of both mainstream parties, largely regarding “censorship” on their platforms performed by the companies themselves. It is beyond the scope of this essay to address the particulars of this issue, so we are going to continue under the assumption that privately-owned social platforms have the constitutional right to censor, manipulate, or otherwise editorialize User-Generated Content (UGC) as­ they see fit, but it will outline specific advantages with regard to “The Censorship Issue” offered by current Federated Social platforms. The reality of Barlow’s fears in 2020: even if the United States government had intentions to regulate speech on The Web, it has consistently demonstrated an inability to comprehend the meaning of such action, much less an ability to enforce legislation within the realm of online speech.</p>\n<p name=\"f447\" id=\"f447\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This essay cites heavily from meta-media publications like the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Columbia Journalism Review</em> and Harvard’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Nieman Lab</em>, as well as from several individual articles oriented around the subject of social media’s impact on the way news is consumed, skewing its bias toward the media industry in many ways. I pursued this direction in order to make what I believe to be an original suggestion: Federated Social Platforms are ideal solutions to this issue, too, largely because of their widespread omission of any non-linear (algorithmic) content prioritization in timelines. Much like Twitter’s original design, content on services like Mastodon and Diaspora appears in a purely-chronological “Timeline,” which — if still present — is now a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highly-obscured option</a> in mainstream proprietary networks. Inevitably, it discusses recent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms (which I will occasionally refer to as “Big Social”) to reform aggregative processes within their functions as news-sharing services as it cites the research critics have referenced in response.</p>\n<h4 name=\"458f\" id=\"458f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Origins</h4>\n<p name=\"3b33\" id=\"3b33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While user-maintained Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) like Usenet and Fidonet established Open Web forums in the 1980s, a proprietary parallel called CompuServe migrated from its original implementation as a “<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" data-href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-social-networking\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business-oriented mainframe computer communication solution</a>” to the public domain. As of Fall 1994, CompuServe charged $8.95 per month ($15.94, adjusted for inflation) for “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/science/personal-computers-the-compuserve-edge-delicate-data-balance.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited use of its standard services</a>,” which included “news, sports, weather, travel, reference libraries, stock quotes, games and limited electronic mail,” and between $4.80 and $22.80 per <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hour</em> ($8.55 to $40.61, adjusted for inflation) for use of its “’extended’ services,” including a variety of discussion forums established by topic. In the 1990s, it would be joined by competing internet service providers Prodigy and America Online, the latter of which originated the first “member profiles” for users, forming the third pillar of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Telecommunications Policy</em>’s Social Media requisites.</p>\n<p name=\"70cb\" id=\"70cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Inheriting the environment pioneered by these original titans were the first college-oriented networking sites like Classmates.com, myYearbook.com, and SixDegrees.com. The former introduced the concept of user discovery by way of grassroots associations and has managed to survive (in some form) to this day. SixDegrees was notable as “one of the very first [Social Networks] to allow its users to create profiles, invite friends, organize groups, and surf other user profiles.” Following social development of the original services goliaths and these insular collegiate networks, another microcosm sprouted up within this first generation of ethnic-oriented networks such as AsianAvenue.com and BlackPlanet.com, which both continue operation to date.</p>\n<h4 name=\"7b31\" id=\"7b31\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The Friendly Frenzy</h4>\n<p name=\"fb29\" id=\"fb29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The meat of the social media industry’s curve throughout its history up to this point is occupied by a string of networks — most forgotten — following the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hallmark of Friendster’s launch in 2002</a>. A year later, LinkedIn was launched as the “more sober,” business-oriented network offering. MySpace — “once the perennial favorite” also launched in 2003. Then, in 2004, TheFacebook.com launched within Harvard University as a means for students to “<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/\" data-href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">search for others in their courses, social organizations and Houses</a>.” Almost immediately (just six days later,) the service’s extensive legal history began when three fellow Harvard students accused founder Mark Zuckerberg of “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com</a>.”</p>\n<p name=\"2891\" id=\"2891\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is difficult to find an examination of Facebook’s commercial success from a critical perspective among technology media that has almost entirely embedded itself within the industry it claims to keep in cheque. The vast majority of technology press organizations are based in either Silicon Valley or New York City. The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Digital Trends</em> article I have just cited heavily from goes on to suggest that it’s a “universal agreement” that “Facebook promotes both honesty and openness,” when an examination of the discourse surrounding Facebook outside of technology culture suggests otherwise. Much of the related literature from academia surrounds the company’s perceived mishandling of “Big Data” and a broad discussion of “privacy” and its perceived new meaning.</p>\n<h3 name=\"a5bd\" id=\"a5bd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Facebook’s Fallout</h3>\n<p name=\"6730\" id=\"6730\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Since the “Cambridge Analytica scandal,” legal attention toward Facebook has become popularized in conversation, so the dissemination of related details is beyond the scope of this essay.</p>\n<h4 name=\"4f80\" id=\"4f80\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Pro-Transparency Within Facebook Inc.</h4>\n<p name=\"d9fa\" id=\"d9fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Facebook, Inc. claims to have made a significant effort to become more transparent, especially since Mark Zuckerberg began appearing in front of special senate judiciary committee hearings in 2017. “Facebook Open Source” publishes regular content on <a href=\"https://opensource.facebook.com/\" data-href=\"https://opensource.facebook.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opensource.facebook.com</a>, including a podcast called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Diff</em>.

Theirs begins with the invention of a hardware project by “open Internet activist” Eben Moglen in 2010 “with the aim of shifting away from large, corporate owned server farms to a more community-oriented model for managing communications online,” called Freedom Box, and its relationship with Diaspora, the first federated SNS. The Diaspora project was launched by a group of Moglen’s students at Columbia University, originally intended a “distributed social networking service that addressed consumer privacy concerns by enabling users to host their own content on a friendly community device, like Freedom Box.” This vision depended on Moglen’s heavy emphasis on self-hosted servers as the primary means for users to maintain their privacy, going forward.</p>\n<p name=\"456f\" id=\"456f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">WIRED</em> article citing the study entitled “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" data-href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>,” Barabas suggests that “most people do not want to run their own web servers or social network nodes.” Diaspora exists today entirely separate of its original creators after its “young leaders” faltered under pressure from investor pressure to “’pivot’ the project to a more sustainable business model,” now in the hands of “the open source community.” As of November 2020, ~76000 total users were registered on Diaspora instances (called “nodes” by the community,) with approximately 17000 active in the past month.</p>\n<h4 name=\"8dec\" id=\"8dec\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Big Social, Overtaken</h4>\n<p name=\"bf2d\" id=\"bf2d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Since 2017, the relationship between Mastodon and Twitter has exhibited a complete role reversal in key feature additions. While almost all of the articles and essays on the subject are keen to point out that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/\" data-href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/04/06/eugen-rochko-mastodon-interview/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eugen Rochko modeled Tootsuite’s original UI after Tweetdeck</a> (now an optional selection called “Advanced UI,”) the “mimicry” between the donor-funded, Open Source platform headed by a single German developer in his twenties and the 15-year-old for-profit social network maintained by a company with nearly 5000 employees shifts in the other direction upon close examination of specific featuresets. Just five months after Mastodon’s first penetration of the mainstream tech conversation in April of 2017 — with its default 500-character post limit and support for up to 5000 — Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced its upcoming expansion from 140 to 280 characters</a>. In October, 2017, with <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon’s second version release</a>, support for image descriptions (alt text) for the sake of accessibility was introduced. While Twitter had long supported similar metadata in images, it did not do so on its main web interface (twitter.com,) Tweetdeck, nor its mobile apps until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">May 27th of this year</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"1b88\" id=\"1b88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many Mastodon instance administrators and invested users had added feature requests on the platform’s GitHub repository for media posts to support audio playback intermittently throughout its development history, but Rochko initially resisted out of fears that allowing users to share audio files in posts would lead to Mastodon being “<a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">branded as a pirate music sharing service, and [their] project would end up getting blocked in search results</a>.” Feedback would appear to have pressured him into giving in to this decision, as audio file uploads were quietly allowed in <a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" data-href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 2.9.1 of the platform</a>, released on June 22, 2019.</p>\n<p name=\"5f0f\" id=\"5f0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Almost exactly one year later, Twitter first <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced testing for “Voice Tweets” on June 17, 2020</a>, which would not allow audio file upload but instead restrict users to recording within the Twitter mobile app in 140 second-long segments. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controversy ensued</a> regarding Twitter’s omission of any efforts to transcribe Voice Tweets, further catalyzed by the subsequent discovery that the company did not have an internal team dedicated to accessibility.</p>\n<p name=\"4247\" id=\"4247\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is still not known at the time of this writing whether or not Voice Tweets have been fully “rolled out” to all eligible Twitter clients, but Mastodon’s latest <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.2 release</a> from August 2020 included an extensive rework of audio players in posts:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"70e5\" id=\"70e5\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"0240\" id=\"0240\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">These features are hardly comparable except for their common disuse. Data regarding status type is no longer publicly accessible for either platform, but my personal experience as a heavy user of both suggests that audio posts are generally not a priority.</p>\n<p name=\"939a\" id=\"939a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the most popular laments of Twitter users for virtually its entire history surrounds the inability to edit Tweets after they have been posted. When I <a href=\"https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview\" data-href=\"https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed Eugen Rochko in 2017</a>, he explained the central issue with implementing such a capability from his perspective:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"a7a1\" id=\"a7a1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">That won’t happen. There’s actually a good reason why they don’t do that. It’s for the very simple reason that you could make a Toot about one thing, have lots of people favorite share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly it says “heil Hitler,” or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"1e19\" id=\"1e19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing\">Instead of live editing a specific status update, <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/\" data-href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon’s Summer 2018 response to the issue</a> — called “Delete &amp; Re-Draft” — allows the user to edit the contents of a post in the compose interface immediately following its deletion, so that no information need be revised while live on the network. Rumors and bugs have contributed to an extensive mythos surrounding editable statuses in Twitter’s case, but CEO Jack Dorsey did explicitly address the possibility in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/de8wRd2TQQU\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a Q&amp;A published by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">WIRED</em></a> in January 2020, saying, simply, “we’ll probably never do it.”</p>\n</div></div>\n",

				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"chapter-i\">Chapter I</h2>\n<p>Gruel never yielded anything to a single soul, but most of the apartment&rsquo;s occasional guests – when they&rsquo;d pay her any mind at all – mistook her resistance for- the indifference of morbid obesity, or the pervading detachment from life and reality resulting from prolonged suffering from the same. Barney had loved her in precisely the same cheesily-affectionate manner with which he did in their kittenhood, uninterrupted for nearly a decade, and thought he knew for certain how she felt about his touch – he assumed that when she fled in a sudden, fluid, ground-covering saunter to her corner&rsquo;s solitude, it was only an unfortunate, but inevitable involuntary reflex to his stocky presence, when in fact his volume failed one hundred percent of his hundreds of attempts to command any whatsoever. In the midst of female and/or unfamiliar company, he&rsquo;d make a point to bend his bulbous puckering down to search for her eyes with his own, rubbing lightly together the pads of his thumb and index finger as he very deliberately extended the whole of the grubby device toward her snout, as if to point at her with the foul racket. For her ears, it was sautéed nails in a chamber pot; for her tastes, it was the sound of death.</p>\n<p>In actuality, she had never once experienced even a wee grain of fear of the imbecile. As it happens, no living being – thinking and not – ever had or ever would, for the extent of his existence. If Gruel had been bestowed with the most boundless, ever-giving gift of complex linguistics, she wouldn&rsquo;t have batted an eye before loudly protesting her sentiments about his life, his noise, and his rank-ass hands as they approached her, sitting static in her green bowelled-out faux leather recliner, attempting to murder him with her eyes. Unfortunately, gray Tabbies are quite unlucky – or perhaps just out of all favor in the eyes of Chance, because they are the least equipped mammals by far when it comes to domestic dialog, though Gruel had learned to tolerate her companion&rsquo;s pervasively meek nature. She was allowed to languish about for the last few years of her life, eating just a bit more than she should every day, warming herself in the windowsills bathing among welcome patches of crisp mountain sun – on especially frisky occasions, even explicitly expressing her disgust by knocking one or two of Barney&rsquo;s collectible anime figurines off their wall shelf and onto the creaky, disused air hockey table in the corner. It&rsquo;s fairly widely-accepted in the scientific community that she, being feline, 1) could not possibly understand her own mortality in any substantial way, 2) could not maintain any sort of concept of the future, and 3) was extremely metacognitively limited, generally – without the ability to self-reflect. And yet, Gruel&rsquo;s day-to-day demeanor – were you able to translate the thoughts occupying the space between her two (especially soft) ears into an English internal dialogue – was full of easily recognizable human utterances.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wish you were dead,&rdquo; in response to Barney&rsquo;s more especially foul habits (like the horrendous rubbing.) &ldquo;Though I am actually going to die before you, you know. I see you there, poking your grotesque digits at me, cooing your fucking jowls, and it makes me sick,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d continue. &ldquo;If we truly are creations of the omniscient judeochristian God, and he chose to keep you, he is no &lsquo;sadist,&rsquo; but a nano-brained sky idiot intent on utterly wasting his limitless time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If domesticated pet conventions were a bit different, and the course of evolutionary feline anatomy altered – if Gruel were able to verbalize and audibilize these sentiments to Barney Blimp from the first moment they came to be together, there&rsquo;s no telling which of them would still be alive, or if he&rsquo;d have turned out a bit sharper. At thirty years old, Mr. Blimp was single, white, and frumpy. He&rsquo;d moved them in to their downtown Denver apartment on his new boss&rsquo;s abrasive recommendation after landing a Senior Software Engineer position at MapQuest&rsquo;s then-new, 17,000 square foot headquarters just two blocks North; the company, itself a continually less-relevant navigation service and mobile application. For Barney, achieving a real tech industry job to which he could show up in pajamas and drink cheap beer had been a point of substantial pride, though the most he&rsquo;d ever mustered would be considered minimal by any self-respecting individual. It was his privilege to watch over The Server Room, with its gray, winking racks, and arid, coppertone heat – where the data of millions of users was stored and exchanged securely. Granted, most of them were elderly – those few not quite old enough to stop driving (according to them, not their children,) but not fresh enough to detach themselves entirely from physically printed digital directions. The gap was narrowing by the week, but Barney didn&rsquo;t mind much – it kept his job consistently low-stress, sparing him daily energy he&rsquo;d need in the after-five dash home to log in and take over for his Mountain Time afternoon shift, watching over the virtual skies through a simulated radar scope on the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation network (VATSIM).</p>\n<p>From around the world, commercial pilots-in-training would log in using complex home built addons to form a cohesive virtual world – the dullest Massively Multiplayer Online Game ever spawned – in which they&rsquo;d simulate every monotonous detail involved in captaining a passenger flight – the flight plan, the kneeboard checklist, and – if the locale was chosen correctly, where a supervisor was present – the communication with air traffic control, including clearance requests, readbacks, handoffs, and approvals – every one of the most irritating bureaucracies involved in contemporary flight. Even the longest-aging simulator titles could be Frankensteined to subject a user with realtime-updated weather, delays, traffic redirection, etc, necessitating a student to use all of the real-world weather monitoring services as they&rsquo;d be required – as well as the judgments which would depend on the data – throughout the rest of their long, hateful, empty careers. After they&rsquo;d earned their certifications to fly real aircraft, the vast majority would be glad to leave VATSIM behind forever. (Not even jet pilots want to digitally recreate the tedium of their day job during off hours.) However, a select few ultra-dorky aviation nerds like Blimp participated for no reason at all except for an especially quaint masochism spending thousands of their living hours engaged in absurdly-realistic simulations of one of two notoriously high-stress jobs – Captain or air traffic controller – without any expectation of compensation. It is in these extremist communities that you&rsquo;ll find the most rule-following, law-abiding, legislation-jerking twerps in existence today. General Aviation Dads are the grunts – the muscle of petty, aggravating adherence to their everpresent FARAIM manuals – a glossy, ten-pound, yearly-updated collection of every single regulation enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration – but most have legitimate careers, wives, and moderately healthy children. Hardcore Simmers, however, are an inexplicably dedicated bunch – bile of the least-socialized sort – not for the sake of competition, fun, nor even mastery. When asked, Blimp spoke of his dedication as if it was an (unsolicited,) diehard duty-bound slavery – he was needed by the community. In the context of their continued function, it was true – he was Ultimate Air Boss of the Denver Area Digital ARTCC – but his sudden, permanent, unannounced absence would debatably result in little more than a minor inconvenience; a few broken, too-Germanic hearts.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reality of his role, Barney Blimp needed to be needed, as one says. Over the course of his half-decade participation in the organization, he had somehow amassed over 20,000 online forum posts, communicating with the membership – which maintained a populace of fifty or so – and logged some 4,500 hours as a virtual air traffic controller. He&rsquo;d flown a little high-winged Cessna as an adolescent for an hour with an instructor – his mother&rsquo;s gift for his fifteenth birthday – and had savored every one of the handful of opportunities his working life allowed him to fly commercially, an elderly laptop balanced on his knees and a massive headset strapped to his skull, streaming and scrutinizing every monotonous exchange between the relevant parties of his flight. Friends and co-workers tended to catch on to the Blimpisms quickly – and knew they necessitated consideration as charming sensibilities – or they would be unsuccessful in forming or maintaining any sort of relationship with the man – he zealously held his obsessions in indefatigable First Priority, which was undeniably the only respectable thing about him, for Barney Blimp was in adulthood a zealot of indifference, above all.</p>\n<p>The computer fan whined into another of its labored peaks and the bottommost of the four blue lights in the tower&rsquo;s inner lip began to pulse quickly for a few moments before its blinking returned with the wind to their intermittent normality – an endless, untiring oscillation that Gruel had more or less concluded to be the thing&rsquo;s unholy breath. A voice – preadolescent, muffled, and rurally earnest pushed its way through a three-figure headset and three days' worth of dandruff from above.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tacoma ground, Southwest six one seven&hellip; mic check.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Southwest six one seven, Tacoma ground hears you,&rdquo; Barney breathed. The sudden nostril whistle from his inhale had started her from her waking dream in the everlasting twilight of hypnosis that defined his room. Never day or night – the displays over which his eyes were perpetually rolling were always the primary, unsatisfactory source of light. This abominable furniture ruled the cat&rsquo;s life by proxy, as her companion was totally bewitched by its relentless, all-hour religion.</p>\n<p>He shifted forward, clicking and dragging more rapidly, his feet clawing dumbly at the rubber to creep him as he cleared his throat. His eyes did two laps of the bottom left screen before he settled them on its bezel and raised their brows, expecting a request.</p>\n<p>Just he began to inhale again, it came through, hesitant and crackling. &ldquo;Tacoma ground, hello. Southwest&hellip; six one seven requests IFR clearance to Phoenix.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At once, Blimp straightened his back and faced his left screen as he queued the keyboard, inhaling deep to begin &ldquo;Southwest six&hellip; one seven, you are cleared to Phoenix viaaa&hellip; Correction, as filed. Maintain 5000. Expect flight level three five zero ten minutes after departure. Departure frequency one two zero point four. Squawk 7500.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He leaned back in his chair for the retort, taking his can of energy drink with him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cleared to Phoenix as filed. We&rsquo;ll stay at 5000, expecting three five zero in ten, over to departure on one two zero point four. We&rsquo;re squawking seven five zero zero for Southwest six one seven.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Southwest six one seven, readback correct. Expect runway one six left via&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And it went on. All of Gruel sat spread over her paws, wearing into the same spot of the musky white carpet – a few inches behind the office chair&rsquo;s serrated, coffee-stained rubber mat, her ancient girth holding the white globules, bent. A crater would be her legacy – the final record of her thousands&hellip; millions of hours spent watching hairy white feet idly shift in ambient electric gloom, while her deranged, dysfunctional guardian looked at the wall, mumbling numbers to himself in spurts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-iii\">Chapter III</h2>\n<p>As the trio exited the Baker St. headquarters, five brawny mercenaries in gargantuan cargo shorts silently climbed out of a Volvo SUV 1,200 miles West under a red-swathed, beautifully late-sunrise sky o’er the parking lot of a suburban Oakland Trader Joe’s. Instinctively, four promptly fanned out behind the fifth point in a pseudotactical formation as they crossed the rutted asphalt to the sliding automatic door, and instinctively, they formed up once more to enter it, ruthlessly retracting a shopping cart each in perhaps the most efficient manner five human beings have ever done so. With their comically small vehicles (none of the men was shorter than six foot one; none less than 230 lbs.,) they fanned out again – still wordless – in an even distribution across the aisles to the existential astonishment of the three, groggy-eyed cashiers on the opening floor.</p>\n<p>Were you to snag the security camera footage – perhaps even just that of the wide-angled unit at the far end of the store – you’d be responsible for a swiftly-Bacterial Internet Video, no doubt. The men each produced a PDA as they infected the empty rows of goods at almost exactly the same, clinical pace – looking to double check a list they unanimously knew by memory, anyway. #1 grabbed 3 gallons of organic, grass-fed whole milk, 2 gallons of high-pulp, fresh-squeezed orange juice, 3 cartons of organic, free-range eggs, 74 ounces of organic, certified-humane goat cheese, 1 16-oz. container of organic <em>cottage</em> cheese, and an entire, 7.5 lb. wheel of organic parmigiano reggiano. #2 went for premium, organic canned goods. #3 ordered two each of nine cuts of the best stead available from the bewildered butcher… <em>and so on</em>.</p>\n<p>Less than ten minutes after they’d arrived, the entire crew descended upon the checkout lanes with nearly a quarter-ton of combined merchandise, but the staff had prepared – a panic over the radio had even drawn out the <em>General Manager</em> to occupy a lane, and the lot – usually annoyingly friendly (they were paid very well to be so) – were almost completely silent, reflecting the curt intensity of their massive, intimidating customers throughout the ordeal. It turned out to be mostly unnecessary – the last hulk out turned his crew-cut head and forty-pound neck to smile and wave.</p>\n<p>“Have a good one,” he said.</p>\n<p>The fivesome pushed their carts to the car, the plastic bags crackling a cacophony. The tailgate was lifted and the rear stuffed full – the last man piled the remainder in the laps of the other three passengers as they sat, chuckling at the vehicle’s visible, squat burden as he aggregated the empty carts and jogged them back to the stack. The driver followed shortly after to pick him up and the whole, fully-loaded operation proceeded to the freeway, chariot slogging under the load.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>Lenny snorted a healthy bump from the tip of his knife in the back of the Mulsanne as Pith diced the blow with a Kroger Discount card atop an original Guttenberg Bible in the next seat.</p>\n<p>“Jesus wept,” he said.</p>\n<p>The job was less than arduous – it was the good stuff.</p>\n<p>“This has the potential to become your first <em>good joke</em>,” noted Tharp from the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>“Have – had you ever done this before?” asked Lather, sniffing and swallowing with his drip, at once impressed and surprised that he’d retained his ability to speak in correct tenses.</p>\n<p>“Technically, yeah, but it’s been a helluva while.” Pith arranged himself two gluttonous parallel lines before retrieving a bespoke sterling silver straw from his breast pocket.</p>\n<p>“It used to be small-town newspapers – two years ago, if memory serves.”</p>\n<p>“A <em>bad</em> joke,” said Lily.</p>\n<p>“_Not _a joke, by the way – some would call it philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“Uh huh&hellip; Wack.”</p>\n<p>“I think they’re all a lot better off now, and don’t tell anyone, but my faith in local journalism is one hundred percent sincere, hand on heart.” He pointed the straw at the first line and proceeded to lap it up, thumb on opposite nostril. Reeling, he then carefully passed the Lord’s Word &amp; silver hoover to Lenny, stifling the fiend’s temptation to once again attack his steno pad.</p>\n<p>“Uh.” Tharp turned in want for alarm to watch two police interceptors in full, angry blues ’n’ twos speed by the hastily-arrested traffic in the oncoming lane to slide and haltingly screech in front of 1555 Baker St., from whence the three had just come. “That’s overreacting.”</p>\n<p>“Great for the scrapbook though!” Pith smiled and looked at the camera bag by Lenny’s feet, then to his eyes, then to the bag, and back again, but it was no use – he was fucking slammed, eyes lost in Theo’s salmon and yellow reflection in his window, and their light was green. The scene of the crime was soon out of sight.</p>\n<p>“You know, federal prison would be <em>fascinating</em>,” he added, slapping his thigh.</p>\n<p>Lily scoffed.</p>\n<p>“You’d be fucked.”</p>\n<p>“You could come with, I’m sure! It’d be a riot! You could infiltrate the guards… Or, hey! You could apply for a wardenship. That’s real you.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to know how much that’d cost you.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Actually</em>…”</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>The Volvo exited the swiftly-congesting freeway and its haggard multitude of late-week commuters for Nob Hill, the San Franciscan angles seriously testing its overloaded suspension and the precarious arrangement of its occupancy. The driver took 6th St. South, descending through cafes and theaters to video stores and payday loan offices before parking adjacent Market St.</p>\n<p>Hazards on, he fished his mobile phone from the center console and made a call.</p>\n<p>“We’re standing by,” he said, but a tremendous turbodiesel whistle interrupted him from the other end.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“We’re waiting.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I <em>said</em>… WE ARE HERE.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“… HERE.”</p>\n<p>A pause. <em>More</em> whistling and the trailing end of a garbled scream.</p>\n<p>“..AAT?!”</p>\n<p>Exasperated, the driver removed the phone from his ear and began melodramatically pounding out a text message with his ginormous thumbs – backspacing, mostly – clicking and popping over the steady ticking of the hazards. From behind the huge artisanal cheese wheel, a passenger loudly cleared his throat. After a few extraordinarily difficult minutes, the brute in the front seat finally decided to turn with his lap-bound bundle of full egg cartons and share the crude joke he’d been sitting on with the three abreast behind him, but was interrupted by the sight of a rogue city garbage truck turning through the intersection of the prior block. He tapped the driver’s shoulder and gestured generally rear before slumping back (as much as was possible for a man of his size) in the seat, frowning.</p>\n<p>Staying the ticking, he pulled out, garbage truck now in tow, and began the descent to the Tenderloin District and its bleak spectacle of waking homeless. Up and down the lines of them they went, stubby necks craning – tracing a search pattern in the dilapidated, pothole-ridden grid. After fifteen minutes, the driver’s eyes began to flirt more and more worryingly with the alarming display of the fuel gauge, but then he spied his prey, finally, across from where they waited at a red light for nobody – six men in ragged coats; two sitting on the ledge of a concrete retaining wall bordering a pitiful garden containing nothing but a handful of weeds at its epicenter, one prone in a sleeping bag at their feet, and the rest forming a semicircle around a black steel trashcan with a wide, well-ashed rim.</p>\n<p>“<em>Alrighty then</em>,” he sighed, running the red. The garbage truck didn’t hesitate to follow and the convoy parked directly and evenly in front of the bin. In an almost ballet-like unified coordination, the occupants of both vehicles egressed – the four Big Men holding the handles of the bulging grocery bags they’d cradled in their laps, the fifth headed rearward for his own handful; the two high visibility jacket-swaddled waste disposal crew, one carried a roll of standard black trash liners, the other stuffed both hands in his pockets – to the undivided attention of their audience, including the occupant of the sleeping bag, who’d rolled over at the noise as if to say <em>do you mind</em>, but remained silent. The two groups formed lines, facing one another – seven on six. The two men on the ledge descended to their feet without thinking, expecting _some _kind of trouble from this lot.</p>\n<p>“Hey!” one shouted, but there was no response save for the rustling of the plastic bags held still. They stood that way, searching each other’s eyes for a full minute – an eternity, but not a one of the street’s original, rightful six had formed any theories. Finally, the driver stepped forward and with his left hand swung a bag full of smaller, limper bags full of fresh vegetables so that it rested on the lip of the trashcan. He fixed his eyes on those of the sleeping bag man – by now sitting up with his gloved palms flat on the ground behind him, wearing an explicitly puzzled set of eyebrows – and began deliberately pulling the produce out with his right hand, one by one, only to throw them straight into the can’s opening with building aggression. A beet, two carrots between two fingers, a series of onions… All surrendered immediately to the black, fetid abyss. He went on like this – eyes unwavering – until his bag was empty and he turned, wadding it up to toss it in the gutter, where it began immediately to open again and travel away in the breeze.</p>\n<p>The next two stepped up with their load and began upon the same. Bananas, individually peeled off the bundle, then Granny Smiths – faster and faster – Red - then Golden Delicious, lemons, oranges, half a dozen grape vines, handfuls of kiwi, a whole bag of cauliflower heads. Theirs filled it to the brim and they stepped aside for the second trash man to remove the lid, coax the drawstring of the bag off the inner container’s lip, and hoist the whole up and out of the basket to the ground, where he quickly tied the top into a knot and set off with it for the truck as the first tore a new liner from his roll to replace it. He held the bag with both hands, whipping its expansion with the wind, then shoving his right hand into it and down the basket, wrapping the end around the outside, replacing the heavy lid, stepping away for the next two.</p>\n<p>“Hey… what the fuck man?”</p>\n<p>The sleeping bag man’s voice – unused for the better part of a day – was mostly lost to the wind, but it would have been futile, regardless. With purpose, the process was repeated – three trashcans full of the freshest high-dollar groceries, coldly… hatefully deposited – until the lot was depleted and both mercenaries and disposal men returned wordlessly to their respective vehicles and sped off in opposite directions, leaving nothing but horrid offense and a small storm of crinkled plastic bags bearing the words _THANK YOU _in dark, Trader Joe’s green.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-ii\">Chapter II</h2>\n<p>All-nighters had not-so-gradually become a habit. Perhaps if you’d even rudimentarily charted his sleep over time, he’d have startled (assuming he wouldn’t be able to distract himself away,) but he’d continued to successfully grow his vices exponentially, under his own conscious threshold. It’s not as if he were <em>actually</em> unaware of what it meant for a human body to constantly consume so much caffeine and sugar in order to force it through so many nights, but his inhibitions had shrunk within him as his ability to conceptualize his own future had faded – by now, into virtually nothing.</p>\n<p>He was arriving, this morning – as to the increasingly-frequent others – without having slept a wink through a particularly lively Wednesday night as the primary Boss of all airspace in and around the greater (digital) Seattle-Tacoma maze. The more sustained traffic there was – <em>operations</em>, as they’re called – the greater the test was of Barney’s ability to shepherd – or, <em>vector</em> – and delegate incoming &amp; outgoing flights. He’d truly entered a brainstate of primal gluttony for occupation of his mental bandwidth – the vast majority of his life decisions across the board could be explained by servitude to his especially tedious preference in stimuli. After the indulgence of the night-long deluge, he’d hand off his post as the sun came up to reflect in relative stillness amidst his rapidly-hushing beta waves.</p>\n<p>This morning – as on the increasingly-frequent others – he planned to dither about for precisely long enough to make him seven minutes late to work, which involved the mindless, protracted consumption of two bowls of bland instant oatmeal over the course of ninety minutes while a progressive loop of the television program <em>M*A*S*H*</em> played, mirrored on both his computer screens at near-whisper volume.(fn) Whatever was left of his attention was dedicated in its entirety to his smartphone’s display as he methodically sifted his favorite internet message boards for the most current available Joke Images of a popular, but universally-crude, de-intellectual type. When he happened upon an especially effective example in private, he would involuntarily produce a brisk, mild whooshing nearly identical to that of a muted sneeze – when among casual friends or twice-found acquaintances, the discovery would cause him to steadily, nasally chuckle for an empty tenth of a second or so longer than was generally appropriate.</p>\n<p>Continuing to self-administer the necessary beverage to sustain his function simultaneously with so much otherwise-unaccompanied oatmeal meant he would almost always need the restroom, where he would sit – still scrolling – until precisely nine minutes before his intended time of arrival to the downtown office on Blake Street. He’d swing out of the bathroom and tend to the inevitable mess his breakfast would leave in the common area with barely enough effort to warrant a thin excuse later to his slightly more fastidious roommate, Craig.(fn) This time, he not only left his dirty, oatmealed bowl in the sink, unrinsed – he failed to place the gallon of milk back in the refrigerator or even replace its cap. For a moment, he winced at the new boundaries he was pushing, but the clock on the stove already read 8:30, and it was ten minutes and forty-one seconds ahead.(fn) He haphazardly dumped a cup of kibble into Gruel’s pan – which she would wait over half an hour to acknowledge for the sake of her pride in front of her constant illusion of an attentive audience – and set out the sticky, offset door unshowered and unshaven in the same dour sweatshirt and lustless, stonewashed jeans he’d been wearing for over two days.</p>\n<p>Down the steps, around the only corner convenience store in Colorado that carried Hell-brand energy drinks, and by the hideous Pepsi Center stadium went Blimp, pumping his stocky limbs, inducing his singular facsimile of the phenomenon known as <em>Runner’s High</em>, which was enhanced by the caffeine in his system and his tired, anxious brain’s above-average indulgence in adrenaline. This tendency of the body to react to sleep deprivation by entering an amplified, exponentially gradiented state of charged excitement (or, panic, for some) out of self-preservation was an especially significant one of a few responsible culprits in the reward system that sustained Barney’s new lifestyle. Challenging his body this way manifested an artificial sense of adventure which even the grandest possible pleasures at his imagination’s disposal could not.</p>\n<p>It undoubtedly didn’t help that his employers were not in a position to punish his mediocrity <em>or</em> reward any excellence, as their service’s usership had been in decline for almost a decade. MapQuest, originators of the convenient format of digital navigation, had been unable to maintain their relevance – operating at a loss since before anyone left in the office could remember when. As per the unfortunate, long-pervasive status quo, Blimp’s late arrival – at 8:34 – was not observed by anyone but himself. Through reception without a glance, then the badly-aging, bizarrely-lit, haphazardly-colored habitat of his groggy, destitute coworkers, past the small central “huddle rooms,” each marked by a graphic of a smartphone search bar containing a fantastic destination – <em>Taj Mahal, Pyramids of Giza, Colossus of Rhodes,</em> and on – Barney Blimp sought his half-desk in the open mid-rear of the space.</p>\n<p>He plopped and slumped in his chair, but stared at the worn neon geometric shape in the carpet by his feet for a brief moment of dissociation before logging in to stare in exactly the same fashion at his work inbox. When asked about his indulgence in sleep deprivation by the few friends who knew him well enough to be concerned, he would cite his responsibility to the virtual air traffic community as a mentor and sentinel, but the reality was that <em>he enjoyed it</em> – most of the results of asking one’s mind to extend its healthy uptime constructed a high for him that no other practice or substance, alone, could. The stress would maintain a state of hyperawareness while in front of his screens, and would help remove him in a critical way from the tedious and mundane of his daily life. Some part of him was reading emails, yes, but it was less conscious than it would’ve been – than it was for his loopy, reductive, hideously-daft deskmate, Edgar, who was technically Blimp’s subordinate, but had long since realized Barney Blimp’s total lack of interest or finesse in delegation. There was little in the way of other faculties in him, save for an impressive, practiced ability to carry a single-sided conversation for hours.</p>\n<p>“So apparently my Grandma managed to fuck up my parents’ new DVR with <em>Judge Judy</em> recordings in less than a week – I think they bought it the day before Easter or something.” Neither man moved from their skimming.</p>\n<p>Edgar huffed.</p>\n<p>“I know I should care about the acquisition thing but uh… as long as the coffee is still good, ya know? Fuckin Thursdays,” he said, huffing again. “I think we’re gonna try to get a new TV soon so I can have the one in the living room. Hopefully 4K.” (fn)</p>\n<p>Barney looked beyond his display to the fake petrified wood siding on the far wall, idly trying to remember the last film he’d seen for any reason other than the excuse to gluttonize liberally-buttered popcorn. <em>Something Millionaire</em>, he thought. With Craig and his super-hippie girlfriend, maybe two weeks after he’d first moved in. He’d sipped down four and a half bottles of her homemade pilsner and they had all three more or less simultaneously turned ill. Probably food poisoning – that* rock-in-the-stomach* sensation, but nobody had actually thrown up, if his memory served him. They’d just gone to bed somewhat early and neglected to do anything together since, which didn’t bother Barney as far as he could tell – he preferred to socialize through the coy and entirely-controllable context of clearances and vectors.</p>\n<p><em>Fuckin Thursdays</em>. What a foul, meaningless expression to be breaking the beats of his dissociation! <em>What a foul life</em>, his head said.(fn) His gaze returned to the unread messages in his inbox, tricking him in a momentary spell of dizziness. The <em>Thanks</em>, before his supervisor’s boss’s signature in her memo from the previous week with the subject line “Further thoughts/heads up on the future” briefly became <em>Thursdays</em>, in his periphery. <em>Fuckin</em>, he thought. His neck began to cramp, so he shifted his legs, took another putrid gulp of Hell, and again fingered the scroll wheel. “FW: Friday’s HUGE BLOWOUT PARKING LOT SALE” from his landlord – who’s stimulant prescription, petty, shapeless home life and resulting general aggravation with procrastination led him to carry on the notion that Blimp might one day fix his derelict hatchback, if prodded enough – became “FW: Fuckin HUGE BLOWS.”</p>\n<p>He smirked in insolvent agony.</p>\n<p>“…like I could do some A/V on the side or something instead of going out every other night.” Edgar’s granular drivel had finally managed to cross the threshold of Barney’s awareness. “I guess I don’t really need the extra cash, but I looked at my savings to pitch in for the TV and it <em>sucks</em>.”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp gave him all of an exhaling, cocked head side glance with a vanilla smile. “Same here,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuuuckin Thurs-days!</em> It was musical now – too quickly mutating in time with the melody of <em>Rule Britannia.</em>(fn)</p>\n<p>*My sav-ings real-ly sucks. Bri-tons ne-e-e-e-Ever will be slaves! *And it continued… Without REM sleep, his mind’s ability to parse relevant information was in steady decline, which made for him his Hell’s Hell; his surrealist heaven. <em>Fuckin Thursdays.</em> Enough of his consciousness was left to wonder why so much of mindless contemporary office dialogue orbited around the topic of which day of the week it was, how that came to be – or, if it had always been an inescapable fact of human existence.(fn) <em>Fuckin Mondays</em>, in so many words.</p>\n<p>In the office chat window behind his inbox, the occupants of the whole were doing their *Thursday morning *best to professionalize their panic in their responses to an announcement that had been pinged company-wide just a few minutes before.</p>\n<p>“***Correction: he’ll be visiting today at some point.***”</p>\n<p>Even if Barney had been sufficiently present in this fuddled reality to take notice, his inattention was already elderly enough that it wouldn’t have mattered. Telecom companies had been curiously (but not altogether passionately) circling MapQuest for its liquidatbles like lazy, non-committal buzzards for so long that it scarcely crossed the minds of any but the remaining three executives – and even they had considered their tenure too unappetizing to warrant much worry. It was assumed that their parent company, AOL, would be bought soon in a huge, several billion dollar merger, and that they would be brought along – if not for any other justification than sparing the bidder the inevitable inconveniences of a split.</p>\n<p>Edgar was again submerged in Blimp’s ether – now on the topic of “vintage” stereo receivers: how analog units could still be adapted for digital cable boxes, and why they should be – as he set about writing his first reply of the day cross-department to the head support tech about an issue with duplicate integrated customer reviews from other services that they had both agreed to overlook nine times already in Q1 alone. This time, though, a single Yelp! review of a Des Moines brasserie had reportedly been pushed in over 450 duplicates, blanketing the page with broken text for who-knew-how-many users, which was posited to potentially cause a cascading series of bugs across several servers at any moment. Continuing to argue that the issue was not yet worth any resources from the position of a Senior Programmer would have been a truly audacious display of negligence, but Barney was feeling especially lazy, so he began.</p>\n<p>As the refusal was pounded into being, a slight commotion stirred in the direction of reception and a young, supremely professional-looking woman dressed from heels to hairpins in bright silver strolled dangerously quickly through the far doorway toward the corner office carrying a black leather document case. Chief Technical Officer Peter Built – its sole occupant – was the first to notice her and look up from his screen, chin still on his palm when he made contact with her eyes. For a second too long, he felt a primal burst of absolute terror, but he managed to push away from his desk, button his blazer, and stick on a smile which she half-returned as they met at the doorway.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Built,” she said, reaching for his hand.</p>\n<p>“Ms. Tharp.”</p>\n<p>From where she’d been moments before, two disheveled young men followed like straggling ducklings, turning around in wonderment with gleeful smiles, taking in their surroundings as if they were just entering a petting zoo for the first time in their newly post-infantile lives. The first was a noticeably superior mess – tripping over his ruthlessly-worn brogues, rapaciously swinging a fringed camera bag with distant, bloodshot eyes. The other looked nearly as maniacal, but his suit was obviously tailored, if composed by a colorblind madman – apparently for none less than a clown. It was primarily salmon wrapped in a banana taffy jacket, and it couldn’t possibly have clashed any more vigorously with the pumpkin orange, neon green, and royal purple palette of the whole godforsaken office.</p>\n<p>He led the other now, practically rubbing his hands together as he strode between the common area’s ping pong table and the bleary-eyed pair – Barney Blimp and neighboring Edgar, who was still obliviously babbling – studying them as if he might just stop to bend down for a closer look. Tharp and Built had paused their business to look on as if watching their respective pets sniff each other at the park, free of the leash. The messy one took a place in the corner at the intersection of the two thigh-to-ceiling panes of glass window and their gray, mid-morning sky as the adorned man leapt atop an unoccupied desk, knocking over an ergonomic keyboard. He began speaking without prompt or context.</p>\n<p>“You wanted to know Theo Pith’s identity. I am the man who has asked that question.”</p>\n<p>Only a few yards away, Peter leaned back on the metal frame of his office door, grabbing it for support. Edgar finally shut his mouth and swiveled to look at the commotion, aghast.</p>\n<p>“<em>I am the one who has asked that question!</em>” shouted Pith, stifling a giggle. He jumped to the floor, satisfied with the handful of gazes he now held, and began pacing.</p>\n<p>“Too many of the individuals I encounter have an irrational, often very intense bias or mistrust of any institution that is <em>selling</em> them something. To them, the customer is always the priority in business interactions, and I&rsquo;ve been wondering&hellip; why? <em>Is</em> the customer ‘always right?’ Should I really assume - as a business owner who&rsquo;s made my life into a particular product or trade, who&rsquo;s probably read about regularly for years, likely been forced (if not sought) to examine the quality of my efforts directly and indirectly against vectors of peers of the same profession, and habitually ponders such things several times every day - that an individual who more likely than not has <em>no other vested entrance</em> in my industry should be treated as the higher authority? That any old bloke who walks in to my operation – literally or metaphorically – is superior to myself, even in that space. The idiocy is easily evident, but the mentality is more destructive than you&rsquo;d think.”</p>\n<p>Built – still watching, wide-eyed – moved timidly to a worn “chair” (nothing more than an orange semi-solid fabric cylinder) and sat deliberately down, leaning forward to clasp his hands together in front of his knees. Ms. Tharp remained where she was, watching Theo in noticeable boredom atop a morsel of amusement. In the corner, the most distressed of the entourage shifted his weight to the other foot, producing a steno pad &amp; pen from his jacket’s inner pocket and attentively jotting two sentences upon it. The event had finally captured Blimp’s attention and turned his glassy eyes, but his hands still hovered in stasis over his keyboard. Increasing the velocity of his pacing further still, Pith continued, green eyes strafing the scene.</p>\n<p>“All of us know somebody who knows how to use their customer privilege to their advantage, consciously or unconsciously. To be fair, I think it&rsquo;s unconscious – not malicious – for the majority. These folks will call a customer service number and scream *dissatisfactions *and threats at all the poor souls in the hierarchy until they get a refund, a lower price, or some other special privilege. And for that, they&rsquo;re often rewarded – they are an insignificant enough fraction of the base that the industry can afford to give in to them, and so it perpetuates&hellip; But what if you had the opportunity to skirt the risks and buck the bitches back? What if you had the opportunity to be proud of your product and not give a damn how it&rsquo;s received? What if you were given a ticket to the ride on that bubble – that security that only the impossibility of failure can enable? What if I told you I wanted to make that happen for MapQuest? What sort of transformations would this office undergo?”</p>\n<p>A man and woman turned briskly ‘round the far corner of the conference block on their way back from the opposite break room, simultaneously ceasing their chat and their speed upon the spectacle. From the outside street, the dampened sirens and buzzed honking from a passing ambulance could be heard through the soundproofing. The audience of the raving now totaled ten souls, most bewildered.</p>\n<p>“I realize that I crash my own wedding – that it&rsquo;s basically both arranged <em>and</em> whirlwindish, but research on relationships shows that both sorts are much more successful than you might suppose!”</p>\n<p>He paused to show a smile to the whole room. It was left unrequited.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps we should proceed as if these are the only two types – perhaps <em>that</em> would give us a chance at imagining something truly different. I have always loved your platform, personally – I have myself carried many directions along successfully to many unfamiliar places, and who knows how much I should thank you all for how much resulting calm!”</p>\n<p>He paused again to look off – as if daydreaming – to some distance of his imagination beyond the ceiling’s dotted tiles. “Ah, the effect of nearly anything printed! A more serene spirit than a screen will ever provide, I think… and that is why I’ve bought you.”</p>\n<p>He left a silence – still without expectation of a response – before beginning yet again.</p>\n<p>“The last time I slept, I had this dream. There was this couple – a man and woman – living in a sort of Roman/Venetian hybrid future where the Catholic Church had bought Google and begun to use its platforms to sell Indulgences again to billions of users. Like&hellip; AdSense, but significantly more aggressive, and soliciting financial reparations for sin. I first met the guy&hellip; looked <em>exactly</em> like Paul Walker, told me he raised cattle. I was a consultant or something&hellip; working on redesigning an obscenely efficient HVAC system for the Church, for no other reason than&hellip; well, they suddenly had <em>even more</em> cash, and actually couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to blow it fast enough. One day, I get a call about an explosion on the project and I find out that Paul Walker, his girlfriend, and their friendly pet panther, Sophie are the prime, on-the-ground triad of an anti-Googlechurch terrorist organization. This whole digipapal monstrosity was just explicitly conspiratorial and hilariously evil with so much sudden, consolidated power and wealth that it actually crippled them – they couldn&rsquo;t organize quickly enough.</p>\n<p>“So, I&rsquo;ve been thinking – independently of my subconscious, of course&hellip; well, as independently of one&rsquo;s subconscious as one can possibly think – I’d like this acquisition to be an opportunity to reimagine ‘longform’ directions, if you will. You guys have spent the past few years building a very competitive and unique mobile navigation experience, and I think you’ve done an astonishing job with the resources you’ve had – you’ve definitely made Google *feel *like idiots among themselves, but it’s time we make them <em>look like fools</em> to the rest of the world for treating the sacred task of guidance with so little respect. Detailed, precise directions are MapQuest’s wheelhouse, and the ways you’ve figured out to express that philosophy in a mobile app are truly astonishing, but now that you have essentially nothing to lose, I want to take this company back to its roots… its home grass.</p>\n<p>“I know&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you have a bunch of agenda and performance presentations to whip up for me, but I can&rsquo;t be reassuring enough, here&hellip; it&rsquo;s really, just fine. Irrespective of what&rsquo;s coming in and going out, I&rsquo;m going to commit, here and now, to keeping MapQuest in the black. It&rsquo;s completely fine. Whatever happens – just don&rsquo;t dump budgets directly into Ugandan email scams or anything&hellip; try not to topple senselessly, I guess – but whatever happens, you&rsquo;ll all have your jobs for the foreseeable future, but with a lot more freedom to do what you feel like doing. For now, your two directives are simply <em>nobody leaves or gets fired for any reason</em>, and <em>from this day forward, the app will be treated as legacy software</em>.”</p>\n<p>The pacing stayed just in front of the center-desked pair, and Pith locked eyes with the now almost sullen Blimp, clasping his hands behind his back as he curtly bobbed his chin and inhaled for a conclusive followup.</p>\n<p>“This is my supreme Head of Operations, Ms. Lily Tharp,” he said, gesturing toward her stoic post. “And my friend from the <em>Wretched Economist</em>, Mr. Lenny Lather.” From the corner, Lenny looked up from his pad scribbling just long enough to nod in reply.</p>\n<p>“My name is Theodore Pith, and I have bought this company. It is my sincere hope that none of you go home today with negative feelings toward myself or your future here because I can’t emphasize enough how secure it really is. I’ll be in touch, and we’ll be back in Denver within the month for more professional discussions on where this needs to go. Though I intend to get to know each and every one of you, I’m afraid my time is tight, today. That said… does anybody have any questions for the moment?”</p>\n<p>Nobody and nothing. Barney Blimp had long since left his body behind in the words and Edgar was cartoonishly dumbfounded. The walking pair had sat on the furthest unoccupied desks within line-of-sight. Peter Built conscientiously closed his mouth – which had been open for who-knows-how-long, and Lily stared at the floor. Lather had caught up with his steno pad(fn) and leaned against the window that was the wall, sensing within himself the swimming tadpole of insufficiency – he would need more cocaine soon.</p>\n<p>Pith looked at his wristwatch. “Ah, well… it’s early! *Too *early for this kind of talk, I’m sure. We’re gonna jet, but we’ll certainly be returning within the week to meet each of you one-on-one. The Q’n’A can wait till then, of course. Enjoy the rest of your Thursday!”</p>\n<p>This time, he was in the lead out of the office, his smile gone. Tharp wordlessly slipped a bright matte orange business card to Peter as she passed; he looked into her eyes like a begging leper as he grasped it in his fingers like a secret. Lenny lurched off the wall and stuffed his things in his bag, shuffling to catch up. The following silence was profound – finally broken by Blimp from his distant gaze.</p>\n<p>“Fuckin Thursdays,” he said.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER III</p>\n<p>As the trio exited the Baker St. headquarters, five brawny mercenaries in gargantuan cargo shorts silently climbed out of a Volvo SUV 1,200 miles West under a red-swathed, beautifully late-sunrise sky o’er the parking lot of a suburban Oakland Trader Joe’s. Instinctively, four promptly fanned out behind the fifth point in a pseudotactical formation as they crossed the rutted asphalt to the sliding automatic door, and instinctively, they formed up once more to enter it, ruthlessly retracting a shopping cart each in perhaps the most efficient manner five human beings have ever done so. With their comically small vehicles (none of the men was shorter than six foot one; none less than 230 lbs.,) they fanned out again – still wordless – in an even distribution across the aisles to the existential astonishment of the three, groggy-eyed cashiers on the opening floor.</p>\n<p>Were you to snag the security camera footage – perhaps even just that of the wide-angled unit at the far end of the store – you’d be responsible for a swiftly-Bacterial Internet Video, no doubt. The men each produced a PDA as they infected the empty rows of goods at almost exactly the same, clinical pace – looking to double check a list they unanimously knew by memory, anyway. #1 grabbed 3 gallons of organic, grass-fed whole milk, 2 gallons of high-pulp, fresh-squeezed orange juice, 3 cartons of organic, free-range eggs, 74 ounces of organic, certified-humane goat cheese, 1 16-oz. container of organic <em>cottage</em> cheese, and an entire, 7.5 lb. wheel of organic parmigiano reggiano. #2 went for premium, organic canned goods. #3 ordered two each of nine cuts of the best stead available from the bewildered butcher… <em>and so on</em>.</p>\n<p>Less than ten minutes after they’d arrived, the entire crew descended upon the checkout lanes with nearly a quarter-ton of combined merchandise, but the staff had prepared – a panic over the radio had even drawn out the <em>General Manager</em> to occupy a lane, and the lot – usually annoyingly friendly (they were paid very well to be so) – were almost completely silent, reflecting the curt intensity of their massive, intimidating customers throughout the ordeal. It turned out to be mostly unnecessary – the last hulk out turned his crew-cut head and forty-pound neck to smile and wave.</p>\n<p>“Have a good one,” he said.</p>\n<p>The fivesome pushed their carts to the car, the plastic bags crackling a cacophony. The tailgate was lifted and the rear stuffed full – the last man piled the remainder in the laps of the other three passengers as they sat, chuckling at the vehicle’s visible, squat burden as he aggregated the empty carts and jogged them back to the stack. The driver followed shortly after to pick him up and the whole, fully-loaded operation proceeded to the freeway, chariot slogging under the load.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>Lenny snorted a healthy bump from the tip of his knife in the back of the Mulsanne as Pith diced the blow with a Kroger Discount card atop an original Guttenberg Bible(fn) in the next seat.</p>\n<p>“Jesus wept,” he said.</p>\n<p>The job was less than arduous – it was the good stuff.</p>\n<p>“This has the potential to become your first <em>good joke</em>,” noted Tharp from the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>“Have – had you ever done this before?” asked Lather, sniffing and swallowing with his drip, at once impressed and surprised that he’d retained his ability to speak in correct tenses.</p>\n<p>“Technically, yeah, but it’s been a helluva while.” Pith arranged himself two gluttonous parallel lines before retrieving a bespoke sterling silver straw from his breast pocket.</p>\n<p>“It used to be small-town newspapers – two years ago, if memory serves.”(fn)</p>\n<p>“A <em>bad</em> joke,” said Lily.</p>\n<p>“*Not *a joke, by the way – some would call it philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“Uh huh&hellip; Wack.”</p>\n<p>“I think they’re all a lot better off now, and don’t tell anyone, but my faith in local journalism is one hundred percent sincere, hand on heart.” He pointed the straw at the first line and proceeded to lap it up, thumb on opposite nostril. Reeling, he then carefully passed the Lord’s Word &amp; silver hoover to Lenny, stifling the fiend’s temptation to once again attack his steno pad.</p>\n<p>“Uh.” Tharp turned in want for alarm to watch two police interceptors in full, angry blues ’n’ twos speed by the hastily-arrested traffic in the oncoming lane to slide and haltingly screech in front of 1555 Baker St., from whence the three had just come. “That’s overreacting.”</p>\n<p>“Great for the scrapbook though!” Pith smiled and looked at the camera bag by Lenny’s feet, then to his eyes, then to the bag, and back again, but it was no use – he was fucking slammed, eyes lost in Theo’s salmon and yellow reflection in his window, and their light was green. The scene of the crime was soon out of sight.</p>\n<p>“You know, federal prison would be <em>fascinating</em>,” he added, slapping his thigh.</p>\n<p>Lily scoffed.</p>\n<p>“You’d be fucked.”</p>\n<p>“You could come with, I’m sure! It’d be a riot! You could infiltrate the guards… Or, hey! You could apply for a wardenship. That’s real you.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t want to know how much that’d cost you.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Actually</em>…”</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>The Volvo exited the swiftly-congesting freeway and its haggard multitude of late-week commuters for Nob Hill, the San Franciscan angles seriously testing its overloaded suspension and the precarious arrangement of its occupancy. The driver took 6th St. South, descending through cafes and theaters to video stores and payday loan offices before parking adjacent Market St. Hazards on, he fished his mobile phone from the center console and made a call.</p>\n<p>“We’re standing by,” he said, but a tremendous turbodiesel whistle interrupted him from the other end.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“We’re waiting.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I <em>said</em>… WE ARE HERE.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“… HERE.”</p>\n<p>A pause. <em>More</em> whistling and the trailing end of a garbled scream.</p>\n<p>“..AAT?!”</p>\n<p>Exasperated, the driver removed the phone from his ear and began melodramatically pounding out a text message with his ginormous thumbs – backspacing, mostly – clicking and popping over the steady ticking of the hazards. From behind the huge artisanal cheese wheel, a passenger loudly cleared his throat. After a few extraordinarily difficult minutes, the brute in the front seat finally decided to turn with his lap-bound bundle of full egg cartons and share the crude joke he’d been sitting on with the three abreast behind him, but was interrupted by the sight of a rogue city garbage truck turning through the intersection of the prior block. He tapped the driver’s shoulder and gestured generally rear before slumping back (as much as was possible for a man of his size) in the seat, frowning.</p>\n<p>Staying the ticking, he pulled out, garbage truck now in tow, and began the descent to the Tenderloin District and its bleak spectacle of waking homeless. Up and down the lines of them they went, stubby necks craning – tracing a search pattern in the dilapidated, pothole-ridden grid. After fifteen minutes, the driver’s eyes began to flirt more and more worryingly with the alarming display of the fuel gauge, but then he spied his prey, finally, across from where they waited at a red light for nobody – six men in ragged coats; two sitting on the ledge of a concrete retaining wall bordering a pitiful garden containing nothing but a handful of weeds at its epicenter, one prone in a sleeping bag at their feet, and the rest forming a semicircle around a black steel trashcan with a wide, well-ashed rim.</p>\n<p>“<em>Alrighty then</em>,” he sighed, running the red. The garbage truck didn’t hesitate to follow and the convoy parked directly and evenly in front of the bin. In an almost ballet-like unified coordination, the occupants of both vehicles egressed – the four Big Men holding the handles of the bulging grocery bags they’d cradled in their laps, the fifth headed rearward for his own handful; the two high visibility jacket-swaddled waste disposal crew, one carried a roll of standard black trash liners, the other stuffed both hands in his pockets – to the undivided attention of their audience, including the occupant of the sleeping bag, who’d rolled over at the noise as if to say <em>do you mind</em>, but remained silent. The two groups formed lines, facing one another – seven on six. The two men on the ledge descended to their feet without thinking, expecting *some *kind of trouble from this lot.</p>\n<p>“Hey!” one shouted, but there was no response save for the rustling of the plastic bags held still. They stood that way, searching each other’s eyes for a full minute – an eternity, but not a one of the street’s original, rightful six had formed any theories. Finally, the driver stepped forward and with his left hand swung a bag full of smaller, limper bags full of fresh vegetables so that it rested on the lip of the trashcan. He fixed his eyes on those of the sleeping bag man – by now sitting up with his gloved palms flat on the ground behind him, wearing an explicitly puzzled set of eyebrows – and began deliberately pulling the produce out with his right hand, one by one, only to throw them straight into the can’s opening with building aggression. A beet, two carrots between two fingers, a series of onions… All surrendered immediately to the black, fetid abyss. He went on like this – eyes unwavering – until his bag was empty and he turned, wadding it up to toss it in the gutter, where it began immediately to open again and travel away in the breeze.</p>\n<p>The next two stepped up with their load and began upon the same. Bananas, individually peeled off the bundle, then Granny Smiths – faster and faster – Red - then Golden Delicious, lemons, oranges, half a dozen grape vines, handfuls of kiwi, a whole bag of cauliflower heads. Theirs filled it to the brim and they stepped aside for the second trash man to remove the lid, coax the drawstring of the bag off the inner container’s lip, and hoist the whole up and out of the basket to the ground, where he quickly tied the top into a knot and set off with it for the truck as the first tore a new liner from his roll to replace it. He held the bag with both hands, whipping its expansion with the wind, then shoving his right hand into it and down the basket, wrapping the end around the outside, replacing the heavy lid, stepping away for the next two.</p>\n<p>“Hey… what the fuck man?” The sleeping bag man’s voice – unused for the better part of a day – was mostly lost to the wind, but it would have been futile, regardless. With purpose, the process was repeated – three trashcans full of the freshest high-dollar groceries, coldly… hatefully deposited – until the lot was depleted and both mercenaries and disposal men returned wordlessly to their respective vehicles and sped off in opposite directions, leaving nothing but horrid offense and a small storm of crinkled plastic bags bearing the words *THANK YOU *in dark, Trader Joe’s green.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER IV</p>\n<p>The ruckus they had left took a few minutes to build, but those clouds in the glass were beginning to make way for the Spring sun and the implications of what had just occurred filled the office with it, albeit less warmly. They reflected coldly between the spheres of colored furniture and Peter Built noticed for the first time how much iridescence they’d lost since his and his company’s Last Chance, six years ago. In a single 2012 push, they’d completely redesigned themselves – both their space and their service, pushing further into mobile for salvation, despite the fact that every one of their competitors would completely outclass them, there, from the get-go – as yet fruitlessly – and he still abhorred with his whole being the tryhard quirk of both opposing languages, just as he had then. They’d hired a San Francisco firm that specialized in offbeat interior architecture, and the whole project had taken just five months, but it was now hard to believe that it had not been obvious how poorly the space would age, and yet – anything more tasteful than the inelegance of the out-of-style-for-several-years factor would have been dishonest.</p>\n<p>He started the float back to his own vulgar partition and desk – now beginning to bake in the high sun – where his phone was indicating all signs of being paged. Now was not the time. He hovered over the receiver and was stricken with a fantasy: surely, he could make it out the door to the adjacent parking lot with a minimal chance of interception – and even if he was intercepted, he could simply <em>push the interceptee into oblivion</em> – to his car, which he could drive in <em>triple digits</em> to I-25 – he’d never been pulled over for speeding, so surely some form of roadway Karma would serve him – then North for only <em>what, fifteen? sixteen hours?</em> and he’d be freed by the mythical lakes of North Dakota… or Minnesota, perhaps, where he could drop off the grid and fish from a the simple serenity of an eleven foot john boat with his own homemade tackle for *how many years? *before his savings ran out. Correction: <em>their</em> savings – his wife, Ingrid’s and his. <em>She could come too!</em> She would agree to it, with enough pleading, he thought. But by that time, the “heat” would surely be “on” them.(fn) <em>No</em>, he refuted, defeating himself as he picked up the warm receiver and put it to his ear.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Peter?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Mr. Built… the police are here,” said Madge, at the front desk, spooling up his excitement once again.</p>\n<p>“What?&hellip;”</p>\n<p>“The police are here. I called the police.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Those people threatened me! I called 9-1-1!”</p>\n<p>… and he was defeated again, fantasizing now about ripping open the top-right drawer of his desk to grab a boxy Glock handgun (that was <em>not</em> actually contained within,) and blowing his brains onto the detestable colors of the inner wall so that Madge (and presumably, the police she had summoned) would hear the blunt blast through both her headset and the open office.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Mr. Built?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I’ll be right up.”</p>\n<p>He threw down the phone and miserably flummoxed his attempt to half-leap over the desk, funneling the intensity of his resulting shame into a furious beeline march past Barney and Edgar, who had resumed discussing the timetable of his new television purchase in <em>even further</em> detail, oblivious to the volcanic upswell of his deskmate’s internal peril. Blimp was writhing visibly in the Genesis of hyperventilation, cold sweating through goosebumps, rocking to and fro in his $2000 chair. A part of him, removed, was now fully aware of – and supremely alarmed by – the hot, raging toil that was rapidly occupying the controlling faculties of his system to a soundtrack of distorted, infinitely multiplicative instances of that same, spirited performance of <em>Rule Britannia</em>.</p>\n<p>After remaining unnoticed in the same position for the better part of an hour, he suddenly shot violently to his feet, flinging the chair against Edgar’s to stand rigidly with his hands at his sides. The whole present MapQuest population had by now stuffed the space full – most feeling mostly helpless, looking down at their hands, leaning against tables, walls, or chairbacks while the rest traded in hushed hypothesis. Barney surveyed them, moving only his head, slowly – a crazed turret atop his inelastic form.</p>\n<p><em>A̶r͜o̷-ò-̴o-͜o̴-ose͠ ͡from òut ̡tḩe ͢a-͝a-a-̀z̢ure m͘a̛i̴n</em>.͏</p>\n<p>His breathing still quickening, he clenched his fists in the overwhelming noise.</p>\n<p><em>L͡o͞u̡d҉ bla̶s̷t ̴a̛bo̡v͏e ҉u̷s̛,͜ ͡ĺoud ҉b̢laşt th̵at ̢t̕e͢a͟r͘s͝ the͞ ͠ski̴es</em>.</p>\n<p>“…arndog! Barney!”</p>\n<p>In his ignorance, Edgar thought of his behavior as nothing more than a subject to tease – yelling for Blimp, <em>The Corporate Playmate</em> as he returned the chair, back-first with both unwashed hands.</p>\n<p><em>Mo̡re dre͜-e-̢e͜-͏e-̸e̛adf͟ùl̕ ͟f͞r͘om ̕ea͝ch ̨fore͏iģń str҉o̴k͜e̷!</em></p>\n<p>“Hey BARN-dog, what’s the <em>deal</em>?”</p>\n<p>Barney whirled around in a lightening fashion, stealing the chair from his hands and hoisting it – in no mild frenzy – above his head, howling.</p>\n<p><em>S͏t͟il͘l m̀ore m̶ąje-̵e-̵e̵s͜tić s̡ha͜lt͘ t̢hou͝ ̡risȩ,</em></p>\n<p>Edgar’s smirk was still in the process of disappearing as Barney brought – with the fullest potential intertia – the whole mass of the thing down upon his nose, castor-first.</p>\n<p><em>M̧or͠e ̵dread͡f͏u͘l, d̢ŕea̴dful͜ f̷ro̷m҉ ͝e͘a̛c͡h ҉f̸o̸reiǵn ̵ştr̕ok͢e,</em></p>\n<p>“<em>FUCK</em>,” he squealed from under the disjointed heap, toppling to the floor. Barney let go of the lot and set about kicking it with extremely vigorous fury. Edgar’s cry had definitively captured the attention of the crowd; the previously positing of the bunch turned instead to gasping. Both computer displays were lifted high, torn from their cables, and pounded into him with the same veracity and degenerative shrieking.</p>\n<p><em>S̸e̛r͏ves but ̸to ͟r̴o-̶o-̷o-o̷t̸ ͢t͜hý ͠nati̴ve ͢óa̴k!</em></p>\n<p>Not lost enough in that oh-so-intolerable carpeting, Barney’s screaming intermittently dipped into feral, unnatural cackling as he turned away from Edgar’s squirms and began devouring all of their shared workspace’s contents that could possibly be manipulated into his furious maw. First, all three thumbdrives – one from his own tower; two from the corner dust behind the rings of dried cola where the bases of the displays had been. Still swallowing repeatedly to ingest the lump of the last, he started on his own aluminum computer tower, punching its plastic front over and over again until its compact disc tray opened obediently to reveal an ancient bootleg driver installation CD sporting a stick-on label in Comic Sans,(fn) which he violently plucked up and folded, cracking it into 3, then 12, then 36 pieces before proceeding to devour the dusty, glassy mess in handfuls. Complacent with his consumption, he moved on to the next row of used workstations, kicking over anything that stood, gurgling through the blood that now flowed from his mouth.</p>\n<p>At reception, Peter Built was absently addressing two rotundly uniformed, absently present officers – the taller of whom looked to be no more than ten years old (so absolutely that it was by far the most alarming issue present in all four minds, including his.) The young Madge Teeth made it plain that concern for her own safety had prompted her call, above all else, and was yet the only party who had paid any mind to the menacing noises coming from the deeper office.</p>\n<p>“You need to understand, this visit was just routine.”</p>\n<p>“Routine?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, routine.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t scheduled – I had no-”</p>\n<p>“That was my own failing – I assumed an office-wide Slack message would be enough. Obviously, I assumed incorrectly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the placement of his right hand on his chest and a forward tilt of his receded hairline, Peter’s self-criticism didn’t seem to take, so he continued.</p>\n<p>“Truthfully, it’s all my fault. This is all just a misunderstanding – I should’ve taken steps to keep everyone better informed – especially Ms. Teeth, of course – but no crime has been committed here.”</p>\n<p>Madge stood behind her five hundred dollar swiveling bar stool, hands clasped together on her skirt front where they awkwardly remained as she craned her neck around the wall divide to ogle Barney Blimp – now profusely bleeding from his mouth and hands, coughing up shingles of plastic and glass – setting his delirium upon the “City Park” common area and its center stack of business literature.(fn) Her eyes widened as he rolled up a two week old issue of <em>Fortune</em> in order to semi-successfully scarf it down like a chili dog. Elsewhere, two exposed cables from a power supply had shorted, igniting a section of drywall and the surrounding outmoded carpet. Squeals penetrated the swift spawn of black smoke as the sprinkler system abruptly drenched the entire populace. Madge languidly returned her attention – still wide-eyed, now soaking – to the preposterous scene in reception.</p>\n<p>Neither officer had moved nor spoken – their four, dull eyes had remained, unblinking, on Chief Technical Officer Peter Built as he continued to rephrase his apologetic explanation in a futile haste for some action from his audience at increasing volume over the rapid beeping of the fire alarm, lips dripping and spitting.</p>\n<p>“We were acquired last week rather suddenly, you see, and our new owner is a bit eccentric.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t told he was going to visit this morning until thirty minutes after my arrival.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Peter – no veteran of law enforcement interaction from his societal and social position – thought he would try altering his language a bit to sound as close as possible to that of their inter-cop dialogue to bridge whatever obstacle there was between them. He considered the terms he knew from crime television: <em>suspect</em>, <em>pursuit</em>, <em>informant</em>… But none fit, and his recollection was expeditiously exhausted.</p>\n<p>“Communication with his people has been sparse, hectic, and frankly <em>rude</em>, you know,” he said, chuckling emptily through the downpour. The buildup of water in his eyelashes was becoming critical but he could still see the officers well enough to perceive their apparent lack of all perception, to his exasperation. Over the discord of the alarm and the shower from the depths of the office came another especially aggressive war cry followed sequentially by a distressed chorus of both male and female shrieks.</p>\n<p>“My sincere apologies for wasting your time, gentlemen. Naturally, the company can take care of any fines you’d normally collect for this sort of thing.” He gave in to the urge to rub empty his stinging eyes as a group from sales filed between Peter and the officers holding laptops and binders over their faces, bound for the door. Madge gathered her bag and her shoes and followed the herd to the stairwell.</p>\n<p>“No, you know what?” Peter fished out his wallet from his jacket and thumbed out a few pasty, sogging fifties.</p>\n<p>“I can just take care of it myself, right now. How about that?”</p>\n<p>He stepped forward – cash and hand outstretched and dribbling in alms to the two, whose eyes followed it vaguely in thirst – their first significant expression. The three stood unmoving in that way for a moment as more fleeing employees shuffled around them, eyeing the exchange in progress without any remaining care or registration.</p>\n<p>“Look, it doesn’t matter. Just take it!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Just take it and <em>go! Please!</em>”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Hesitantly, the preteen-looking one obliged, pinching the wad between stubby forefinger and thumb before waddling in tow of the refugees, partner just behind, waddling in tow of him. Two programmers dragged a battered, bleating Edgar by his armpits over the floor in front of Peter Built, who watched on with an insubstantial frown, wet wallet still in hand. Distractedly, he turned against the steady current of evacuating employees to his office, where he sat in front of his ruinous desktop(fn) and began constructing another revised off-grid fishing fantasy, still oblivious to the torrent and the pungency of the burned plastic smell which had circulated throughout.</p>\n<p>Also unaffected by the same – but nevertheless losing momentum – Barney Blimp’s rampage had grown in creativity despite having lost its entire spectatorship. He’d managed to entangle a giant, sparking chain of printers, monitors, towers, and peripherals which he dragged with great effort across the feces he had uniformly deposited over both conference tables in the presentation room. If there was any Final Vision which his new, out-of-control self was trying to achieve with all of its trouble, it was not evident to any of the conscious parts of him, nor to any of the three Great Big Firemen who arrived to the odorous corporate apocalypse just as the sprinkler system’s reserve had been finally depleted.</p>\n<p><em>There are still two left in the building</em>, the crowd downstairs had said. But immediately, there was only the one – the drenched Chief Technical Officer Peter Built, who found the intervention of his fantasies by the Great Big Man sent to retrieve him rather obtuse, but he complied with his request to be accompanied out of the building, smothering his irritation in a most British way(fn) – a prefaced apology for the behavior he was <em>about</em> to exhibit.</p>\n<p>“Sorry if I come across rather annoyed – I was just distracted you know,” he explained as he was led firmly by the elbow down the steps.</p>\n<p>“I really do appreciate the service.”</p>\n<p>The remaining Great Big pair in black t-shirts with identically-cracking Denver Fire Department crests(fn) and identically-patterned sweat stains spread out carefully – as their discipline dictated – to search the ghostly ruin of MapQuest’s remaining (and yet defiantly ghastly) crown jewel for the hopeful survivor of… this act of <em>domestic terrorism</em>. Each Great Big independently noted the particularly off-putting color palette of the space but – neither quite secure in their own respective aesthetic authority – no such criticism was verbally expressed. Neither, however, shared the same failing confidence regarding their comprehension of mobile software design.</p>\n<p>“Hey, MapQuest!” noted Great Big 1.</p>\n<p>“Hey, yeah, I think I got this app,” replied Great Big 2, stepping over the disturbing spectacle of a flickering display lying against the spider web-shattered safety glass of a smaller collaborative “Huddle Room,” valiantly attempting to reproduce the color-inverted playback of a lewd elementary stick figure animation.</p>\n<p>“Man, I haven’t thought about MapQuest in forever. There’s an app?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, it’s great – I still use it when we help move Barb’s clients. Lot better than Google Maps, man,” said Great Big 2, and – were the office itself a perceptive, thinking organism, it would’ve suffered in that moment, observing the perfection of this <em>organic</em>, <em>freewheeled, unleashed</em>, <em>reconceptualized</em> marketing opportunity that was flinging, <em>unharnessed</em> into the ether – but it was not sentient (fortunately in just about any other conceivable context,) so the organic ad copy genius of the Great Bigs would go forever unappreciated, though their courageous and <em>seriously juiced</em> demeanor would serve each well in their chosen, infamously-underpaid profession, even (or especially) then, as they discovered the trailing end of a great incomprehensible train of decimated computer equipment weaving around the door jamb of the dark Server Room. Great Big 2 fished his Great Big flashlight from his Great Big belt, but its Great Big batteries appeared to be exhausted completely – shaking it repeatedly didn’t seem to do the trick – so he produced his Great Big smartphone and – after a Great Big wait of more screen tapping with his Great Big fingers than could’ve <em>possibly</em> been necessary – the Light-Emitting Diode came to and revealed at the end of the mass in its gaze the nude, blood-soaked husk of the unconscious MapQuest Senior Programmer, Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“Jesus,” said the Great Bigs.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER V</p>\n<p>In the definitively matriarchal, mostly Germanic travel hub of Limon, Colorado, Barney, Barry, and Betty-Anne Blimp had begun the 1990s in a position to thrive. Barry, a Vietnam veteran with a chipped canine, an inherited family hog farm, and “crazy eyes” was headed down a new life avenue at forty-two in partial convenience store ownership with his best high school bud Tommy and a few of Tommy’s less-than-virtuous associates, which was – in such a prospective intersection of byways: the Kyle Railroad, Interstate 70, and proximity to the State’s two dominant metropolises – the <em>bee’s knees</em>. Marriage to his third wife, Betty-Anne had cemented his newfound potential satisfactorily enough to be granted a business loan from the lone regional banking chain the same week their first and only child was birthed, snipped, and dunked in Lutheran from-concentrate Holy Water.</p>\n<p>Barney’s mother was an embodiment of this Brisk American Process – never doing anything without haste; denouncing even in middleage the necessity (or existence) of <em>The Long Game</em>. Despite her pace, she had found in Librarianism a place of belonging on her first go – graduating from the University of Denver with a Masters in Library Science at just 19 after testing in before she could legally drive thanks to the diligence (and yes, the speed) of her homeschooling. If the Limon Memorial Library could even remotely afford a memorial statue, a towering Betty-Anne would surely grace its grounds now, brass-in-motion with her youthful black curls as near as feasibly perpendicular in a trail behind her form, as the institution owed its entire existence to her ruthless wit and otherworldly, naturally-amphetamined energy.(fn) If one took it upon themselves to speculate, they might suggest that it was indeed her speed that grayed, then bleached her curls white within a single year; that the circumstances surrounding Barney’s creation were from most planes of analysis quite tardy, and that Barry – while perhaps the most appropriately quick match she could’ve made – was a bad decision; that mothering a child after one’s hair has entirely silvered was uncouth and unnatural – much less after it had wholly <em>whitened</em>. One is free to indulge these speculations, but Betty-Anne never traveled in an even remotely slow enough velocity to hear or ponder or engage with them, right up to her Judgment Day before her Maker, in fact, whom she no doubt found aggravatingly dull.</p>\n<p>It’s largely forgotten by those who’ve traversed the class divide in the 21st century that childhood in Barney’s era had changed little since that of his parents’ in diet: afternoon cartoons, ketchup, macaroni, hotdogs, and the lot – albeit a bit more processed. There were still Marvel superheroes, arcades, billion-piece, tediously-assembled model cars &amp; aeros, and Little League. The difference – according to the retrospective ponderings of the architectural Boomers themselves – was in the way Merit &amp; Achievement were processed. They say it was the cushion of encouragement and their own elimination of Loss – as factor, variable, and fact of the reality which they crafted for their kin – that fucked up entirely their children’s potential ability to climb above it. In Barney Blimp’s case, however, the fucking was certainly of more nuanced origin, as “losing” was defined differently, with an even greater weight in his mind than his parents’ generation could have possibly imagined.</p>\n<p>Barney never lost in track, baseball, football, or basketball because he never lowered himself to compete in such worldly things. He found most of his 200-odd graduating classmates lacking in luster, but in the blossoming neo-puritanical world of online gaming, Blimp had the pick of the globe, and from preadolescence onward he spent his time virtually among all manner of millennial punks learning how to challenge himself – in fact, learning <em>above all</em> to be competitive. The ideal gamer in the early days was a brotherly roughhouser who competed even in cooperation, regardless of their success, and the glorified <em>Shithead</em> persona sat well with the jaded group of five highschool friends who adopted and eventually socialized him.</p>\n<p>East by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of the Rockies, the meat of Colorado is – as its nearest Easterly neighbor is so notoriously – <em>fucking flat</em>. In daylight, one&rsquo;s field of vision – one’s entire world – is constricted by the limitations of Earth&rsquo;s curvature, which dooms their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of Barney’s home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions. Over years and decades of existing in such a small place throughout such a formative time, human beings like Blimp and his peers live with a profoundly specific spatial psyche, boundaried absolutely. In a town like Limon, it can be tempting – for a visitor – to sift through the longtime occupants according to how they choose (or – depending on one’s choice position within the nature/nurture argument(fn) – are <em>predisposed</em>) to respond to these boundaries. It is not unreasonable to say – timidly, anyway – that <em>most</em> find comfort within them, and – much less timidly – to say that they lead overwhelmingly more satisfied lives. Others – like Barney’s <em>Limon Six</em> – end up classically claustrophobic and tend to spend significant time and energy in their formation of abrasive relationships with both physical and psychological bounds. An integral compounding effect on this aspirational affliction could perhaps be attributed to their Boomer parents and their intermittent, vague insistences like <em>you can be anything you want</em>, <em>you can do anything you set your mind to</em>, and their infinite variations.(fn)</p>\n<p>The Blimps traveled phenomenally often for a Limon family but never incurred the notion – as long as travel was within their wants and means – to leave North America. Nevertheless, young Barney’s primary preferences for any given road trip were simply for the exploration of altitude; by distant or traversed mountains – by far the most bewitching – and commercial flight, when it was afforded. Whether by backseat or Boeing, the perception of distance enabled by proximity to more diverse typography was nothing less than a treat and his own continent’s allotment seemed plenty. It was these higher experiences that provided him a penetrating catalyst of the sort of ethereal meditation comprehendible only by those who’ve yet to develop past a certain age; the sort which many seek in a plethora of desperations until they’re able to accept its loss. The edged flirtation of Earth with sky were the elemental constants he’d be forever doomed to seek. For the lucky Most, however, the altitudes are not so relentlessly haunting and the six-mile planet is rarely insufficient, but the curiouser of them are universally bound with the whole by their want for understanding that Other aspirational itch as the occupants of each pole are with one another, inevitably, regardless of how fervently they happen to reflect upon the decider.</p>\n<p>The inevitable binding was also for the others of the <em>Six</em> – Leona, Leo, Liam, Lazarus, and Lexie – out of their collectively loosening grip on the special Magic in each, as many or most friendships are, and together they observed in themselves and one another the development of their internal compulsion to find a suitable replacement, and – when at their best – maintained an audit of its power. Most of the instances of need did not come when it felt feasible to fill them with literal wandering as they do not for all but those few with unlimited resources. Farming or service-funded families raise children who must smoke weed and/or drink cheap beer in bulk as their world darkens and squishes, and so <em>The Limon Six</em> of Limon Junior-Senior High School entered their stoner stage shortly after their original congregation, when Barney was fifteen and so wholeheartedly, insularly elitist that his preferred external self-projection was of generalized insanity – though of the least manageably interesting variety – in order to discourage any and all contact with as broad a portion of his peers as possible.</p>\n<p>The fallibility of young Barney Blimp’s plan was his own innate desire for companionship, which 1) prevented the scheme from ever being <em>truly</em> wholehearted and 2) necessitated input from other perspectives, as the execution of any human intention will, thereby contradictorily arranging himself to fail. Lazarus, the Junior – the eldest of the lot – was predisposed to target Barney’s person at lunch hour as a thoroughly weird, but nevertheless compulsively social young man.(fn) It was only September when he one Wednesday sat down across from Blimp and immediately began discussing amateur radio operation and its untapped potential among American secret societies, unprompted.</p>\n<p>“So if the Masons are *not *a secret society,” he began, “why is it that they specifically developed secret methods of identifying one another in public and – really – what even *defines *a ‘secret society’ if not its investment in the development of secret methodologies for its participants’ intra-identification, anyway?”</p>\n<p>Barney stopped chewing with a mouthful of his daily one-dollar ham sandwich and bored his eyes into Lazarus’ resting thumbs. In response, they began vigorously twiddling straightaway.</p>\n<p>“Of course, they made sure to place their symbology everywhere, which I would imagine is probably pretty fun. I wonder if they just screen *National Treasure *on repeat for regular meetings, these days. I would for sure put in for that.”</p>\n<p>Cheeks still bulging, Barney Blimp conceded to full, unabridged eye contact with the weariness of ten millennia.</p>\n<p>“Dude, I’m definitely going to become a Free Fucking Mason, but I’m going to modernize their whole shit. Ham radio, you know – probably the most equally-obscured community for the general populace, equally obsessed with ciphers, and *certainly *the only respective equals in socially anti-social activity for old white men with Asperger’s.”</p>\n<p>A Freshman eyebrow was raised; the Freshman chewing, resumed, and the genius of The Junior Lazarus thought it would have a go at a bit of baity ignorance.</p>\n<p>“I mean, if we all really wanted walkie talkies for our treehouse clubs in Elementary school, then it would only make sense to launch the Masons onto the UHF band, right?”</p>\n<p>“VHF,” said Barney through two-day-old pork and peeled-away cheddar. “UHF is for TVs, radar, and cellular phones; <em>vee h eff</em> is ham radio.”</p>\n<p>Lazarus bowed his head, smiled, and faced forward his palms, and thus – in the chemically vomit-scented lunchroom of Limon Junior-Senior High School – the socialization of Barney Blimp began with a bid to modernize the American Freemasons which – if pursued – would’ve proved to be in vain, for by then, in 2003, almost all of the membership had Hotmail accounts. Liam Libel – a Freshman that year, like Barney and by a wide berth the dirtiest of the <em>Six</em> – did not, but he *did *proudly maintain a subscription to *Reason *Magazine and communicated exclusively in savagely relentless Libertarian shouts. After his particularly-troubled World History teacher developed a gasoline drinking habit(fn) and fell tremendously ill over Winter break, Liam’s class was absorbed into Blimp’s, which was not much trouble logistically for such a moderately-sized student body, but <em>was</em> from day 1 significant trouble for Barney and his surrounding peers.</p>\n<p>The new, consolidated 10:33AM World History block totaled thirty-three students, who were doing their best to <em>physically</em> and <em>spatially</em> consolidate as the last remaining teacher of World History employed at Limon Junior-Senior High School introduced himself.</p>\n<p>“Hello hello hello, welcome welcome,” cooed the diminutive man in that manner which only secondary educators do.</p>\n<p>“New folks, I’m Mr. Drake – hello hello hello and <em>wel</em>come back… Yes, sorry about the space… It looks like everybody’s doing a great job… Good job managing… This is only for a few weeks, don’t worry… Yes, please do your best to settle in… Yes, hello hello hello, you’re in the right place! Welcome welcome welcome <em>back</em>… I’m Mr. Drake.</p>\n<p>“Before we get started with the curriculum for this semester… It won’t be all that different from what it would’ve been if… And I promise you it won’t be further complicated if and when we move to new rooms, of course, so don’t worry about that… I just wanted to talk about a few policies specific to <em>my</em> class for the new folks… A brush up for the rest of you, of course, he he…”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake hobbled all around his desk, the projector, then to the door, which he unpropped with his right moccasin and began to close but reconsidered with an audible <em>hm</em> and shuffled awkwardly to open and prop again with a kick of his <em>left</em> moccasin, mumming <em>hm</em> again, hobbling his way to the thermostat, which he dramatically leaned back, then forwards, then back again to examine, adjusting his glasses and wedging his right hand flat against his kidney to form a tea kettle handle. He looked that way at it for a few seconds before he attempted to begin another thought, aloud.</p>\n<p>“<em>Aaaaaand</em> we’re just going ta… mmhmm, so it looks like… It looks like… I’m going to keep this turned down just so ah… We’re going to keep the thermostat turned down for now… I think there are enough of us to keep it quite warm in here… Of co-… Ah… Of course, if anybody starts to get especially chilly… Chilly, just let me know.”</p>\n<p>“So!” he said, turning to the squirming, now mildly claustrophobic class for the first time, folding his glasses again.</p>\n<p>“I want to begin by talking about the <em>future</em> a little bit, if that’s okay with everybody… Our terrible future! In which we will all be <em>ruled</em> by these little things!” He produced a scuffed silver flipphone from the black leather holster on his belt.</p>\n<p>“Even now, the common man is surrounded by so many things he just cannot understand. His cellular telephone, his car, his home computer… It&rsquo;s hard not to wonder what exactly goes through mom and dad’s minds when they see them operate, huh? It must be reduced down to… Almost superstition, you know? Nothing Voodoo, mind you, but – in some way, deep in the mind of the average schmuck, his cellular telephone is quickly becoming his god.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake returned the phone to its holster and looked behind him to retreat enough to sit on his rough, pockmarked, and splintery cherrywood desk as Mr. Libel himself huffed through the door with a pronounced, angsty furrow in his brow, his right arm holding the sling of his ratty tote over the right shoulder of his even rattier creamy brown leather jacket. Even faced with the density of desks and flustered teens, he did not pause even though one would assume it was surely necessary.</p>\n<p>“Hello hello hello… Welcome, welcome,” said Mr. Drake more quickly, his head tracking Liam’s ungainly slotting upon a free, deskless chair against the farthest wall between twin spectacled boys with matching curly blonde afros, just behind Barney, followed by the careless thudding of his bag on the foot-worn carpet in front.</p>\n<p>“Right!” continued Mr. Drake from his perch. “And for you, it will become a god also, but one of a different sort… Many Godly persons desire their particular deity to do the work; to only interact with what’s on the surface, but you! You hold our newfound technological god as one to be known! And that is exactly how it should be… Not just for the sake of the knowledge, itself, but for the betterment of our lives… Now…”</p>\n<p>He placed both palms on his desk and leaned forward.</p>\n<p>“Before we again begin with our <em>history</em>, I want to tell you something very important… There’s a war on. And… You wanna know a secret?”</p>\n<p>Speaking in a more whispery projection, he leaned his bald patch forward a bit more.</p>\n<p>“There’s a war on… There’s a war on you!” He thrusted his pointer finger at the class – who maintained a collective stoicism – as he hopped again to his feet and began pacing, hands together behind him.</p>\n<p>“It’s on everyone who thinks… Everyone young who learns! It’s on everyone with progress on their minds… It’s a war waged even on knowledge, itself… A war of ignorance.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake paused, swiveling his gaze on his heels, gray eyes wide. In the rear, Liam scoffed loudly over the disinterested silence, slouched all the way back in his rigid chair and hoisting his legs to cross them on Barney’s left shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Ay, YO TEECH,” he yelled in Mr. Drake’s general direction, glancing left and right. “YO TEECH, you blaze tron?”(fn)</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake, frozen in the forward stoop he’d been glaring from, offered no reply. Barney brushed briskly at Liam’s Converses against his head as if they were a lost lunar moth.</p>\n<p>“Yo teech, you just tell me if you want a little somun somun, you know what I mean,” Liam said, <em>Ha Ha</em>ing with his right hand eclipsed over his smile.</p>\n<p>“Dude,” Barney complained. Libel sat up again and returned his feet to the floor, but didn’t otherwise acknowledge the protest. He threw his right arm into an arc over his head and made his hand into a vague pistol shape, pointed at Mr. Drake.</p>\n<p>“Ay, YO TEECH… BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVENA RON PAUL… Ha ha! YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY… THIS COUNTRY GOIN TO SHIT, <em>MAN</em>.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake self-consciously returned to standing upright, but his eyes looked miles beyond the far wall and his students – thirty-one of whom had yet to react at all.</p>\n<p>“Why is it ALWAYS BOXES, <em>man</em>? What’s with the FUCKIN BOXES? YO TEECH, THIS SOME BULLSHIT.”</p>\n<p>Barney set about gathering his things to escape the tirade, but Liam had begun to violently writhe about in his chair and appeared to be quickly descending into a fit, which exponentially slowed Blimp’s organization.</p>\n<p>“DON’T DO THIS, TEECH. DON’T LABEL ME!”</p>\n<p>His whole body was convulsing now and his magazines were bounding and bouncing toward serious altitudes on top of him like wheat chaff as it’s shaken free of the grain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AY YO TEECH… WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THESE CAGES ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And with that, his chair failed him as he shook to the ground on his hands and knees – still hollering in bodily tumult.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;COME ONNNN<em>NNNN</em> TEECH, YOU KNOW I CAN’T FIT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT BOX,” he spat at the rug. Neither Mr. Drake nor his pupils had moved or expressed anything, save for Barney Blimp, who stepped over Liam Libel with his backpack and threaded his way strenuously through the desks and static legs, feet, and empty faces through the door. A hundred yards down the hallway, as he leaned against the exit, a final croaking throw came from behind him.</p>\n<p>“<em>Ron Pal!</em>”</p>\n<p>The creaking of the exit door – hinges wanting for a greasing – and the <em>swooshing</em> of its bottom seal against the muddy black shoemat yielded not for Barney Blimp the fresh Colorado air and lucid sunshine, but instead – through a haze of drug-numbed internal retching and destruction – the stagnantly sterile, ammonia’d atmosphere and lifeless colors of a meager hospital room. From the open hallway to his left came an ambiently echoing broadcast of unexpected contextual quality.</p>\n<p>“Welcome, Frances Fujica Chamberlain, eleven pounds, six ounces,” said a theatrically raspy woman’s voice, followed by a pleasantly rhythmic rock sample.(fn)</p>\n<p>“*BLINDed by the light */ *revved up like a deuce */ <em>another roller in the night!</em>”</p>\n<p>Yet, it was the tiny wall-mounted television that captured Barney’s newly-awoken, moderately-medicated attention. From diagonally across his tall bed with its faded floral sheets and itchy medium blue comforter, the minuscule CRT blared a top-of-the-hour *Good Morning America *graphic.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, America. Breaking news, the FBI takes on Apple demanding the tech giant help with a terror investigation. Are critical clues to more plots hidden on the phone of the San Bernardino shooters? Why Apple&rsquo;s CEO is refusing to help this morning. A battle that could affect everyone with a smartphone,” said the voice of the aging anchor from under a dyed black combover to whom the introduction transitioned along with a lower third graphic that said “JAKE JINGLES, ABC NEWS.” <em>Apparently, it is the morning</em>, thought Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“Good morning,” he whispered. Jake Jingles and his co-host Jaime Jangles then went on about the idiosyncrasies of the G.O.P., quoted and played back a clip of the current President saying <em>I believe so and so will never be President</em>, then a shorter clip of “BJ, a German Shorthaired Pointer” – clearly somewhere else in the studio, sitting obediently, cocking his head at the approaching camera lens – before finally returning to a wide-shot of Jingles and Jangles sitting abreast, smiling off screen at the dog.</p>\n<p>“All right, and good morning, America. There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club&rsquo;s Best in Show Award. He&rsquo;s just arriving here in Times Square. He took a walk there on our green carpet in case you missed it. We cannot wait to meet the top dog coming up. Hear what he has to say about his win. The biggest bone of all.”</p>\n<p>“A great-looking dog.”</p>\n<p>“He walks like a winner.”</p>\n<p>“He is.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely.”</p>\n<p>“Amazing,” said Barney Blimp, all at once noticing how uncomfortable his entire physical being had been left in its current, awfully-upright position against a mountain of pillows that looked promising, but disappointingly lacked fulfilling qualities one tends to hope for and enjoy in promising-looking pillows. He lifted his rear to scoot it down and felt an unsettling tremor of his out of kilter equilibrium atop faint whole-body pins and needles from – no doubt – remaining more or less stationary for hours?&hellip;days?</p>\n<p>“…have more on that later. But right now lots of reaction coming in overnight to that emotional appearance in the White House briefing room from Chief of Staff Eggs White. The former general raw and red-eyed as he defended the President, attacked his critics, and remembered the death of his own son on the battlefield. Chief White House correspondent Geoffrey Gouge starts us off. Good morning, Geoff…”</p>\n<p>Realizing the excess of the television’s current volume was insistently coercing the entirety of his attention, Barney looked about him – despite the dizziness – searching for the remote control. To his left, there was only empty space and the burst of brief, sickly draft from a cycle of the neighboring Intensive Care Unit airlock; to his right, a substantially loaded IV pole holding both black and translucent liquid bags, and a hang-over eating tray on castors which was – quite strangely – surfaced in a bright, neon-green neoprene, and contained a small-book-sized touch tablet. He reached for it, tapping the black screen with his right index finger’s plastic heart-rate monitor in an attempt to illicit life. After a few clumsy tries, he achieved a sort of success: an awkward, large-print menu faded into view with five haphazardly off-center options next to hopelessly-scaled stock graphics: <em>DRUGS</em>, <em>MEDIA</em>, <em>BILLING</em>, <em>SCHEDULING</em>, and <em>SUPPORT</em>. Barney tried <em>MEDIA</em>, but the subsequently displayed controls were muted somehow – left transparent. No amount of tapping yielded any change in the program, which had turned to a montage of B-roll: red-faced parents talking on mobile phones on the black asphalt – crowded to the point of insanity by neutral-colored SUVs outside a sprawling red brick building sprouting the tiniest trickle of gray smoke from the far wing.</p>\n<p>“The driver, look at this, pulled over after he smelled smoke, and that&rsquo;s when flames erupted. More than a dozen students from the Jacksonville area high school had to evacuate. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The children were picked up by a different bus and taken home. No word on what caused this in the first place, but certainly glad everyone is okay this morning, Jake.”</p>\n<p>“Thank goodness for that. And now to that big win overnight for the Los Angeles Dodgers, heading to their first World Series since 1988,” continued Jake Jingles as the slightest electronic pseudodance percussion was subtly faded behind his voice in the background – its 140 beat-per-minute high hats abnormally flattered by the bias of the pitiful speakers within the wall-mounted unit, furthering Blimp’s aggravation with the situation. He amplified his aggression toward the tablet, holding it just inches from his nose as he pounded his fingers on the glass. The original menu came briefly back into view before the <em>DRUGS</em> option was selected, swapping the theme entirely for microscopic, illegible text and alarmingly primary reds. The unassuming white plastic pump suspended in the middle of his IV pole suddenly clicked and began a drawling, whirred chugging. Panicking at the sound and the new movements of fluids he perceived, Barney vigorously attacked the big red <em>X</em> in the top-right corner with every ounce of available effort left in the stumps of his thumbs, and was – to his gracious relief – rewarded with the cessation of the horrors.</p>\n<p>“…guy behind looked so concerned until the last second. Also right now a lot of reaction coming to that emotional moment in the White House press briefing room. Chief of Staff General White, defending the President&rsquo;s calls to the families of fallen soldiers. Also took on the President&rsquo;s critics and opened up about the loss of his own son on the battlefield…”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp sighed in extreme exasperation and threw the tablet down on the tray, sinking under the sheets until his feet felt the footboard and hung over it, both hands desperately gripping the comforter, pulling it over his nose so that only his eyes-up were exposed. A new wave of drowsiness gushed from his numb belly and washed over him like sleepy molasses, tinging his vision light blue as he tilted it with his head on the flat bed below the pillow mountain to focus on a single one of the ceiling tile’s dark red polka-dots. <em>Spackled blood</em>, he thought – the removed Observer of his consciousness noting how much less anxious he was in the moment than he should’ve rationally been, while knowing, of course, that his state was entirely the result of whatever drugs they had him on.</p>\n<p>“Welcome, Leslie Désirée Lund, eight pounds four ounces… <em>BLINDed by the light</em>…”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp’s eyes drooped heavy as his Observer ceased short its attempt to recollect the sequence of events which led him there – wherever <em>there</em> was – it was a bed… a less-than-moderately comfortable bed… and instead considered the definition of “roller” in “<em>another roller in the night</em>.” Not <em>roller</em> as in “high <em>roller</em>,” no. Not “<em>roller</em> blades,” though it… he… <em>they</em> had always wanted to learn how to inline skate… <em>Aggressive</em> inlines. Speed skating was such an elegant, lost art. Why weren’t there more speed skaters swooping and sliding around, bent over with their hands behind their backs to cut through the air oh-so-beautifully… in all State and National parks… in cardigans… and purple sweatbands? <em>What happened to them all?</em></p>\n<p>“…and after the break, Jaime and I sit down with Theodore Pith, the young artificial intelligence pioneer and mogul, now author of a new book about cheese and the end of the world…”</p>\n<p>R-o-l-l-e-r, <em>roller</em>. A flour-dusted light wood cylinder with matching old style handles, loose… Loose, but that’s how they were supposed to be… how they had to be or else it would not roll separately of them… Except it was <em>huge</em>, and growing! Gargantuan! And the hands! Covered in dark black hairs of a simply *vulgar *length and nearly as big… Bringing the overwhelming girth of the surface – the *much *too <em>solid</em> and <em>threatening</em> surface – to flatten his body! Rhythmically rolling and squishing and flattening Barney Blimp and his organs against this awful, foreign bed like *fucking dough! *He was more conscious now, but still unable to move – completely paralyzed… And the hellish utensil was on its way back again! <em>Revved up like a deuce…</em> <em>The toes</em>, he remembered! He and his Observer concentrated everything they had on wiggling their toes… <em>really</em> wiggling… and finally… they wiggled alive!</p>\n<p>Liberated from his dream and waking paralysis, Barney shot up – sheets, comforter, tubes, cables, and all – inhaling massively only to see on the tiny wall television the pale, smiling face, flashing green eyes, and blood-red hair of his new boss sitting cross-legged in a purple chair astride the <em>GMA</em> watermark as the show returned from a commercial break. Opposite a table packed with granite-looking half-pipes full of steaming brown beans were the smooth faces of Jake Jingles and Jaime Jangles.</p>\n<p>“Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of the new, quite controversial but hot-selling book – especially here in New York, <em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything</em>,” said Jake Jingles with occasion.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>, mouthed Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“…and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan barbecue joints, Pith&rsquo;s Chili Trough and Pith&rsquo;s Chili Playpen. We&rsquo;ve got what looks to be a&hellip; Ha ha, well&hellip; a miniature <em>trough</em> of chili right here in front of us. Wow! A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith&hellip; Your book seems well… It seems to be in direct opposition to what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?”</p>\n<p>“SON OF A *FUCKING BITCH!” *screamed Barney, hoarsely. His hands moved to fumble with the tablet again, mouth agape as Jake Jingles fumbled similarly in propping an obnoxiously-covered volume upright for the camera, on screen, struggling to obscure an apparently-obscene illustration of a nude woman covered in cheese – his right hand accomplishing the censorship of all but her cheese-strung feet behind the title text.</p>\n<p>“Yes, that&rsquo;s an understandable contrast to make, Jack,” Pith answered as the broadcast switched to his full-shot angle. He himself was deeply contrasted with the formal wear of everyone present – save for some of the studio audience, perhaps – with his pale, freckled arms sticking out of a plain white t-shirt which said on its front in a loud, large, simple sans-serif typeface <em>TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH.</em></p>\n<p>“First, I&rsquo;d like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared&hellip; Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don&rsquo;t be shy – get your hands dirty! It&rsquo;s Chili Day!”</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith waved wildly and dumbly, gyrating both palms at the present audience, off screen, who whooped and cheered in response. Their audience camera was clumsily cut to a bit later than it should’ve been. Jake Jingles forced a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“Well, there it is&hellip; You&rsquo;ve got to love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?”</p>\n<p>Jaime Jangles chimed in with an addendum, first two right fingers drumming on her chin.</p>\n<p>“And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?” She gestured toward his torso, emptily smiling.</p>\n<p>“First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there&hellip; I&rsquo;m actually going to start digging in, if you don&rsquo;t mind,” Theodore Pith said, shoving the provided logo-adorned bib under his right thigh.</p>\n<p>“No, of course&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll join right in with ya,” replied Jake, who sat forward and looked helplessly at the massive task before him.</p>\n<p>“I, myself, really don&rsquo;t find the book&rsquo;s argument in conflict with my love of- and affection for chili, particularly.” He threaded the provided (and also logo-adorned) garden trowel under a great yellow-brownish gop of beans and scooped it toward his maw, spilling a few ounces on the oversaturated rug. Jake Jingles was having one hell of a time shoving his own logo-adorned bib into the front of his shirt without rubbing his live lapel microphone unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>“That argument being – as I understand having read as much as I could last night – that our obsession with food is&hellip; Well, sort of rampant and infecting our culture-”</p>\n<p>“&hellip;and stealing attention from important efforts in humanitarian policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you <em>do</em> finish the book – and I really hope you do, George, really… – you’ll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it is by now our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome&rsquo;s time to fall, if you’re catching my drift.”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp was now a reddening, rigid live wire – his fury crossing a threshold in his heart monitor, setting off its alarm in triads. <em>Beepbeepbeep</em>.</p>\n<p>Jake Jingles – now equipped properly with logo-adorned bib – looked across the table in building agitation at Theodore Pith, twirling his clean trowel. From beside him, Jaime Jangles – yet to be misnamed, and thus slightly less huffy – offered her intermediation.</p>\n<p>“I have to say&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my Me Food – I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his <em>even more</em>, and it&rsquo;s hurtful, the suggestion that my interest in good food is somehow wrong or dangerous-”</p>\n<p>“&hellip;oh, James! Don&rsquo;t look so bashful! Please, do eat your chili!”</p>\n<p>There was a great, gaping, deadly live television pause filled with the swishing and swashing of the pale Pith’s rhythmic chewing over the 140 beat-per-minute electro beat, his otherwise quiet person in frame, t-shirt now covered in brown, eyes cast downward to the half-empty trough before him.</p>\n<p>Jaime Jangles cleared her throat.</p>\n<p>“I’m Jaime, actually…”</p>\n<p>The eyes came up with a full mouth, from which hung a six-inch-long string of cheese.</p>\n<p>“&hellip;oh shit, I&rsquo;m so sorry! That&rsquo;s really embarrassing&hellip;”</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith looked to her, then to the camera and back. Behind the camera, the audience conveyed together both amused applause and inverbal admonishment.</p>\n<p>“Jaime, please let me make it up to you… have some of <em>my</em> chili!”</p>\n<p>Jingles and Jangles cringed, smiled, and managed chuckles with all the restraint in the world.</p>\n<p>“Hey, now! There are families watching this live, Mr.- ”</p>\n<p>“…gosh, I am so sorry.”</p>\n<p>Theodore looked to the camera covered in chili as the shot cycled back to him.</p>\n<p>“Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-”</p>\n<p>“…let’s just try and get back to the book, alright?”</p>\n<p>“Sure, sure&hellip; It&rsquo;s really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.”</p>\n<p>The triplets of the Barney Blimp alarm had finally summoned a disheveled young orderly, who bussed immediately around the dismal bed to cease it in a blur of dark purple and Chanel No. 5.</p>\n<p>“Good, good! It’s good to see you up… Barney-“</p>\n<p>“Please turn off the television,” he said.</p>\n<p>“… I’m sorry?”</p>\n<p>“TURN <em>OFF</em>… the television. Turn off the TV, please.”</p>\n<p>The orderly looked up from the tablet on her forearm to the screen, where Jaime Jangles was hesitantly playing with her little shovel.</p>\n<p>“Wow, yes, I can&rsquo;t even visualize… How long did the process take, do you know?”</p>\n<p>“At least three&hellip; Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was,” to <em>wows</em> from Jangles, Jingles, and the audience.</p>\n<p>“For God’s sake, turn… it… <em>OFF!</em>”</p>\n<p>“That&rsquo;s actually&hellip; really no time at all,” said Jake.</p>\n<p>“Really quick,” nodded Jaime.</p>\n<p>“OFF!” screamed Barney Blimp, in a single, swift motion picking up the tablet and hurling it – inches from the nurse’s nose – to a perfectly placed impact on the little TV, cracking its screen and inducing a brief blip of white noise blinds, yet neither the horrid appliance nor his visitor flinched a bit. The later calmly returned her attention to her own tablet, then to the IV pole’s machinery.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Blimp, please try to control yourself.”</p>\n<p>Jake Jingles again stiffly manipulated the bright-orange volume, turning it in profile and then over, very deliberately assuring that the cheesy woman be excluded from the shot.</p>\n<p>“It&rsquo;s nearly five-hundred pages, right? And this is your first book?”</p>\n<p>“First <em>published</em> book under my own name, you know. I&rsquo;ve written a few other things, here and there, but that&rsquo;s a subject for another time.”</p>\n<p><em>Aw</em>, said the audience.</p>\n<p>“Sure, we’ve got to have you back some time,” said Jake Jingles with visible grit in his smile.</p>\n<p>“Jesus,” said Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“But, this apocalypse&hellip; Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or&hellip;?”</p>\n<p>“All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world…”</p>\n<p>“Mother<em>fucker.</em>”</p>\n<p>“…in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit&hellip; And yet, we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.”</p>\n<p>Up went the young woman’s eyebrows as she tapped her tablet, unpainted fingernails clacking.</p>\n<p>“Look, I’m sorry about the TV, but could you <em>please</em> just turn it off for me?”</p>\n<p>“A striking thought,” said Jake Jingles.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” she replied, making eye contact for the first time, eyebrows erect with no minimum of patronization. “I can’t do that, Barney, but I <em>can</em> have something to eat brought up for you, if you’d like.”</p>\n<p>“<em>…another roller in the night!</em>”</p>\n<p>“Quite. And that was the idea, but it&rsquo;s also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope – that Rome&rsquo;s decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I&rsquo;m glad you brought this chili with you&hellip; It <em>is</em> quite an achievement,” said Jaime Jangles, having eaten half a trowel’s worth.</p>\n<p>“How does that sound, huh…? It’s Chili Day!”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp gripped the handles straddling his bed-bound prison so ferociously that he soon blacked out.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Gravel, it is with great haste and discretion that I write you regarding a patient who was received in the care of St. Nicholas’ ICU on Thursday afternoon (the 8th) – Barney Barry Blimp, age 30 – with a few requests in the interest of his particular and quite consequential needs on behalf of his very long-time friend and employer, Mr. Theodore Pith, who is deeply distraught and regrets that he is unable contact you personally at this time.

In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of <em>The Nice, Huge Estate</em>,(fn) Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was <em>especially</em> reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all <em>his</em>, without a single worthy challenger.</p>\n<p>In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been <em>even more</em> otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at <em>Nice, Huge</em> – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.</p>\n<p>The latest favorite pastime of <em>Nice, Big</em>’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him(fn) – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.</p>\n<p>“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“You’re not <em>busy</em>, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.</p>\n<p>“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Finally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.</p>\n<p>“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”</p>\n<p>Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say <em>guffaw.</em></p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”</p>\n<p>Lenny Lather had not… *could not *have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.</p>\n<p>“Jesus <em>Christ!</em>” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD *in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been <em>guffawing</em> plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing *– hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.</p>\n<p>As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.</p>\n<p>“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.</p>\n<p>“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.</p>\n<p>“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Right-o, as you say, sir!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Down to the <em>pu-hb</em> for a <em>spaht</em> of <em>brahn</em>-dee with me <em>mae-its</em>!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“<em>Oncemo-ar</em> right, pip pip!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“By <em>jah-lee</em>, there we are!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named <em>BLOOD</em> had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors.(fn) The first to spot <em>BLOOD</em> had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as <em>BLOOD</em> had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.</p>\n<p>“<em>Jesus Christ</em>,” had said the shortest.</p>\n<p>“<em>Holy fuck,</em>” had said the youngest.</p>\n<p>“<em>Gee whiz</em>,” had said the oldest.</p>\n<p>And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes <em>BLOOD</em>’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “<em>FUCK!</em>”</p>\n<p>The Sucking’s <em>FUCK</em> and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic <em>guffaws</em> with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.</p>\n<p>“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best *Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.</p>\n<p>“Tally-<em>ho</em>, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to <em>sneak</em> for a swift, full-chat <em>dart</em>, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People *Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, <em>excuse me</em>-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in <em>his</em> store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food &amp; Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been <em>in spite</em>. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his <em>excuse me</em> lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys &amp; Leather.</p>\n<p>“Sir! Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“*Excuse me! *Sir!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”</p>\n<p>Keys &amp; Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”</p>\n<p>“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys &amp; Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation <em>and</em> arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.</p>\n<p>“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish <em>haha!</em> before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.</p>\n<p>“Man, <em>come on</em>,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.</p>\n<p>After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that <em>BLOOD</em> and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me <em>alone</em>?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.</p>\n<p>“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.</p>\n<p>“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As <em>BLOOD</em>’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-<em>BOOM!</em>”</p>\n<p>Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify <em>BLOOD</em> by <em>name</em> from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their <em>effectiveness</em>, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.</p>\n<p>Two days after they’d taken the third wheel, Theodore mailed to the store’s main address an anonymous bundle of cash totaling almost three times the sum value of the cheese “in interest,” which included a long, sappy letter addressed personally to the Artisan and went on and on about how he – the mastermind – had discovered in his crime the magic of her art, stating and restating in outpouring artisanal prose why she should never be afraid to put so much of herself in her perfect medium of expression – titanic wheels of five-figure cheese.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as if getting caught wouldn’t have been the absolute pinnacle of the thing,” he had suggested to Lenny that night over an uncharacteristically serene scotch in front of an uncharacteristically cozy wood and what had seemed to be – under all reasonable scrutiny – an uncharacteristically reflective and relatively sober Theodore Pith compared to the impressively consistent inconsistencies he’d been so far growing to expect.</p>\n<p>“Imagine being tried and convicted for <em>stealing cheese</em> and forevermore knowing you could choose to introduce yourself with the story of your brief, prolific success in a most 18th-century crime, and back it up with transcripts, newspaper clippings – even TV news stories, if you can pull it off… or, making for yourself the temporary obligation to explain in a job interview that yes, you did indeed have a recent criminal conviction on your record… for running out with <em>three wheels of cheese</em> from the same place in the same store within the same month.”</p>\n<p>The noise of his own sobriety had been like a beehive with a tide in the back of his head, pulsing, ebbing, spiking, then fading – a buzzing multitude of footprints were the withdrawals left there by a diverse nature of substances. Some were more tangibly linked to physical sensations of vocally-specific need, as nicotine so quickly becomes and as alcohol shall be, one day, if you explicitly and repeatedly overdo it. Others left equally unpleasant sensations that could be – to the body – of an unknown cause entirely, like the sharpness of certain amphetamines, which we one can only miss consciously.</p>\n<p>“So, yes, incrimination and money are both more or less inconsequential, but why the apology?” he had asked through a dip in the amplitude of the tide. The scotch had seemed to be treating something. He had felt most of it in his toes.</p>\n<p>“And such an <em>extensive</em> apology… Was it guilt? Or do you just get off on your raw insincerity so blissfully that those hours of your time couldn’t have been spent on a single more pleasurable activity than writing a bullshit apology to a woman you’ve never met in which you expertly validate a worldview and a set of preferences that couldn’t possibly differ any more from your own?”</p>\n<p>“Both and neither,” Theodore had replied, pouring the last quarter of the bottle between them.</p>\n<p>“Guilt is nothing but regretful incompetence, which – depending on the perspective from which you classify – I may or may not experience or act from. From my own, I would argue that mitigating the possible damage done collaterally by a stunt like this is effort owed to <em>my own vanity</em> irrespective of the wellbeing of however many cheese-obsessive people may have been affected or not. Inadvertently harming some person or persons seriously – in spirit, mind, body, or all three – while spinning around a brass-headed cane and playing with a slippery monocle is just embarrassingly sloppy, primarily – and by its nature dull, unoriginal, and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>“My ability to balance out unforeseen consequences of my exploits is satisfying if only in its reinforcement of my control over my own impact on my environment. Theft as an abstract is always going to make the thief look weak in the end, no matter how much he may or may not be aggrandized in popular culture. Violence is vulgar, brutish, and uncivilized. Anybody can demoralize, steal from, or beat up anyone who happens to have less power at that moment – the power to alter perception, though, is the ultimate entertainment device.”</p>\n<p>It had then occurred to Lenny through the noise of his extreme sobriety from all that was not scotch that he should’ve <em>definitely</em> been taking notes; that the chances of hearing Theodore so explicitly explain his truths ever again were virtually nill, and that he had been altogether <em>horrendous</em> at his profession since the World Trade Center had last towered over Manhattan, but before he had found the necessary bearings to further formulate any sort of rectifying action, he’d lost consciousness there in front of that supremely cozy fire.</p>\n<p>And now, as he walked with a certain glee through his nocturnal space by the more concentrated softened yellow of the “Nature Observatory”(fn) with a leather-bound journal and a golden-nibbed pen in the big front pocket of his beige utility jacket – despite enduring the downward slope of the amphetamine and laudanum concentration in his blood – he was yet unprepared by what there was of these in him, still, to comprehend his own incompetence. Though he could recall that brief, noisy consumption of his truth by his own sober measure, he was spared the obligation of understanding it, or worse – <em>using</em> the pen and the journal to articulate it in a way he would not be able to forget. Nevertheless, the cheese heists were definitively the most fun he could remember having, for reasons which he did not find important enough to justify disturbing his deserved respite from the burden of words.</p>\n<p>Often, Pith would blast both sides of two or three early-90s, edgy sample-speckled Australian rave cassettes at deafening volume from the parlor while he stomped around reading real-estate trade journals until he’d pass out and fall face-first into the polished oaken floor, the towering wall shelves of collectible classics, or – if his luck happened to be severely deficient – some piece of dark, dense, hundred-year-old furniture, where he would remain for twenty or thirty hours in deep recovery sleep. Lenny Lather did his best to take advantage of these lapses in his supervision by wandering the great old house, sifting through what of Theodore Pith’s possessions that could be considered personal or intimate – the great Guttenberg, where it lay spread open on a pulpit in the corner of the library most of the time when the Master was at home – and the numerous lesser instances of Theodore’s blasphemy, which he’d originally supposed to have gone forgotten as the toys belonging to a child of plenty often do, but the few tests to which Lenny Lather had subjected his memory so far had been unsuccessful in shaking loose any neglected ends. It seemed that he had not forgotten even his most petty, miniscule acts of obtuse indiscretion, chaotic disruption, or perplexing inconvenience, due in no small part to the odds and ends contained within the expanses and crannies of <em>Nice, Big</em>’s nearer and further quarters, most now repurposed (although not all permanently) into personal galleries.</p>\n<p>Nothing so unseemly as Holy shrines, their walls were covered by and large with great photographic prints themed as you’d expect within the rooms of the manor of an elderly aristocratic globetrotter with a penchant for civic engineering and local media. There was <em>The Obits Room</em>, covered in magnified prints of southern Wyoming newspaper clippings(fn) in minimal black matte frames over floor-to-ceiling pink identical to the color of a popular antacid, which unsettled Lenny Lather’s core to no end – the gastrointestinality of the matching furniture and linens made him feel as if he was being digested in the huge stomach of a heinous mutant with an appetite for sentimental rural memoriam. Closer scrutiny of the text – as was encouraged upon the first stop of his first tour of the estate, being a newsman himself – would reveal that it was less than legitimate, at best.</p>\n<p>“Every business quarter,” Theodore Pith had explained with a certain glee, “I require a staffer from a sequentially-chosen one of my papers to write and publish their own obituary. It helps keep one’s perspective fresh, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>Naturally, as a quite recent acquaintance and grateful guest in his home, Lenny Lather had politely and absentmindedly agreed, while internally, he had entertained the all-too-resonant thought that he had been writing his own obituary for years, yet – to whatever extent he was himself aware of it – he was the only individual for which Theodore Pith was inexplicably tempted by sincerity, and thus eager to sate his resulting curiosity. It was not clear whether or not he enjoyed the innkeeper role, or – especially at the origin of their meeting – anything which could be substantially shared at all, really.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER VII</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp had already scratched and felt for the back of his neckline several times, assuming it was the tag of this – his favorite navy blue t-shirt – that was causing the irritation, but as he wiggled to reach it again, he felt prickling and motion. Startled and sweaty, he swung his shoulders wide and propped himself against the rim of the bathtub with his right elbow, turning his body, head, and eyes toward their extremes to see that it was nothing but a Poinsettia, potted in golden foil-wrapped plastic atop the lid of the toilet tank so that its especially scratchy green, red-spattered leaves protruded well into the space of any occupant who happened to get comfortable enough on the pot to lean at all back.</p>\n<p>“This is insane! You are all <em>actually</em> insane,” came the unusually crass whine of Lazarus’ little brother – whom Barney had always struggled to name since they’d yet to have a significant interaction in the two years he’d been coming over – through the bathroom door from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>“Yes, you’ve got it so hard, don’t you? You know, when I was your age, I had to save my own money from the car wash for two summers just so I could pay for my own trip – <em>bus ticket included</em> because *my *parents wouldn’t set aside the time to take me themselves… to Blackload on the third,” replied the booming baritone of Mr. Luger, with whom Barney Blimp and the rest of <em>The Limon 6</em> – including his own son, Lazarus – avoided eye contact if at all humanely possible. He’d slid up from the basement over half an hour before and was long finished with his business, but the notion of traipsing right through the middle of the family dispute to get to the basement stairs – which was directly open to their argumentative kitchen – had paralyzed him there, waiting for a resolution or some equivalently appropriate opportunity to return back to the social safety of the <em>Smash Bros.</em> game on the downstairs TV. The side effects of his anxiety were then further exacerbated by the stillness of the humid heat in the Luger house, which was never within much of a confined temperature, as suburban houses purposely tend to be. Though theirs was by far the largest, most convenient, and most accommodating gathering place offered by the parents of the <em>6</em>, it managed in many subtleties – like the nagging placement of the Poinsettia plant, the air of disuse created by the stubborn geometric perfection of the vacuum rows left in the unblemished white carpet, and the required assistance of an occupant to navigate the particulars of either entrance – to be just uncomfortable enough to discourage one from spending large, unbroken blocks of time within it. It was an especially searing July evening in Limon – outside, the turbulent energy was just beginning to bleed off from the earlier one-hundred degree high, yet throughout Barney Blimp’s extended bathroom stay, the wide brown vent before him had yet to offer any cooling pity for the sweatsoaked, red-cheeked teen.</p>\n<p>From the kitchen came a huff and an obnoxious tirade of shuffling papers.</p>\n<p>“Well I think things have changed, <em>Dad</em>,” whined the smallest Luger again. “Do you remember the old brochure having a flying saucer with a crucifix insignia? Do you remember it mentioning ‘preparing oneself to graduate from the physical to the purely psychospiritual realm?’”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Or saying anything about bringing ‘only the most sentimental touchstones and humble garments the child wishes to carry with them to the other side?’”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Or how about the following sentence, which reads ‘though the child may choose to bring these for comfort, they may also choose to come to us unsoiled and unclothed, as they came to the physical Earth; as they shall leave it as childs and pilgrims of Blackload,’ huh? Does that sound right to you, Dad?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Look, I think they’re just tryin’ to say in a clever and funny way that’cha cain’t bring ya Gameboy, son.”</p>\n<p>Through his nose to maintain his stealth, Barney Blimp sighed. His thighs were beginning to stick bothersomely to the toilet seat and – in his eavesdropping’s intense fixation – he’d been fooled twice again by the unmannerly plant. He reached behind him and moved it to the bathtub, taking great care to set it silently down. From under the floral tiles beneath his jean-topped sneakers came an unintelligible shout from Liam in the basement along with the easy low frequency <em>knock knocks</em> of East coast hip-hop. He leaned forward to slide the slats of the lifeless grate open in time to hear “…without rule of law,” and closed it again. Carefully holding the loose steel clasp of his belt to keep it from jingling, he rose, deliberately did up his clothes, and stepped at once to the shag mat in front of the plain white door.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care… Anything else! <em>Literally</em> anything else, Dad!”</p>\n<p>Barney grasped the brass doorknob gradually so as not to wiggle it within its execrable bracket and turned smoothly out the bolt so that he could crack it open just enough to see the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>“Look… I’m not trying to be the bad guy here, you know,” said the huge Mr. Luger more somberly now from where he was stationed with his coffee mug by the empty sink. “I never had so much fun as I did at Blackload, I don’t think, and it’s not like I could <em>ever go again</em>. Think about that!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Never! No matter how much I paid or pleaded, and <em>oh man</em>, I wish I could… You bet… Sure do… You got no idea.”</p>\n<p>Sitting on the opposite four-legged stool with only the short spikes of his gelled scalp and the back of his gargantuan *M*A*S*H- *t-shirt facing Barney’s crack was the befuddled Little Luger.</p>\n<p>“Dad… I can’t go to this. I will go <em>anywhere</em> else! <em>Vacation bible school</em>, Dad! I will go to vacation bible school!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I would rather *waste my whole summer *in the church basement watching <em>The Lion King</em> a billion times with braindead toddlers if you want, but you <em>can’t</em> make me go to Blackload.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Barney’s observation was abruptly soiled by a broiling spike of agony from his abdomen so consuming and intense that a shrill yelp leapt out of his mouth through his peeping gap directly at the talking two in an extended, dramatic resonance. And yet – as the spike melted as quickly as it had sprung into a dull, wet ache – he noticed that they had not reacted to the cry, nor turned to discover him. <em>This is odd</em>, he thought, but the garbled sounds their two mouths now emitted were stranger still – gibberish, indecipherable – yet within the maintained tonality, though, of their respective pouter and soother positions within the summer camp debacle. Barney Blimp tried to inspect his ears with both probing pinky fingers, but they were much too big to fit.</p>\n<p>“Eeg,” said Little Luger in protest, gesturing angrily at the pamphlet in front of him.</p>\n<p>“Eeg,” his father responded, leaning his large belly and mug over the counter, obediently inspecting the literature in apparent confounding thought. Motion in Barney’s periphery moved his attention from the two to the mouth of the stairwell across the kitchen to their left, where – through the gaps between the white support legs of its border railing – a suspended silver cylindrical condenser microphone floated fluidly, slowly upwards, rising up the slope of the stairs, its head and illuminated green power-indicating light facing the pair as they continued arguing obliviously in tongues. As it crept, its mount and adjacent black metal pole stand came into his view – steadily on its careful course – then a white hand with red painted nails; the tip top of Lexi’s blond bowl cut and elven ears. From the bathroom door, Barney saw her stop just short of peeking above the kitchen floor, her grip for an instant wavering before all sound and motion ceased – at once, father and son stopped speaking and looked fast at the microphone where it hung just below the wood rail, recording them.</p>\n<p>The three were trapped as such for an epoch: the father, against the counter, face toward the invading equipment without expression; the son, opposite him and looking also with his chin on his thumbs; Lexi, out of their line-of-sight, held fast, and then retreating down with the contraption at the pace she had come, descending with the device, which the duo followed in unison with only their eyes as it went down beneath the floor again.</p>\n<p>“Boop!” said a damp voice from ahead. Cold bone pushed on Barney’s nose and it all went black and under, then yellow again. He sniffled and it was rubber – the odor of a high school gym. “<em>Boop!</em>” again, and the breath was louder, but he shot open his eyes and grabbed the bone. It was an unhealthily yellowed index finger attached to the strangely-balding man above him and his graph paper collar, grinning gray teeth, and a cleft chin.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Barney, my friend,” he said, “it is the time for you to awaken.”</p>\n<p>“Egch,” was all the reply he was obliged, for the abdomen ache had been mortally enlarged and was again returning – with its grimacing victim – to life. Barney involuntarily abandoned his hold on the man’s finger to hold with both hands his own tortured middle.</p>\n<p>“Fuck. Ow,” he groaned.</p>\n<p>“<em>There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club’s Best in Show Award</em>…”</p>\n<p>In front of his clutched stomach and the white floral slopes of his blanketed knees and feet was the hellish appliance – the tiny, cracked television, now strapped on top of a distressed black metallic cart with the wide dirty yellow band of a tow rope, placed so close as to be in apparent contact with the foot of his hospital bed, which had been wheeled into a windowless, much more sinister space. The tiles of the ceiling were stained all over and the faded custard wallpaper was contemptuously torn in the far corner from the obscured doorway behind a gigantic, crosshatched pile of wooden and blue plastic clipboards that filled most of the unevenly lit floor space – certainly taking up half as much again the space made for Barney Blimp and company.</p>\n<p>“<em>A great-looking dog</em>.”</p>\n<p>“<em>He walks like a winner</em>.”</p>\n<p>“For God’s sake… Who… the hell… are… you people?” he asked with great effort, wincing through his teeth. The yellowed man had turned his daft, gray grin away and flipped through the crisp paper sheets on the clipboard in his forearm’s crook, pausing to belch once, twice, and thrice, churning his chin into many again and again with his nodding.</p>\n<p>“Barney, wow… It’s good to see you up and at’em again, eh?&hellip; I’m Dr. Bill, a resident psychiatrist here at St. Nicolas General.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Dr… Bill-”</p>\n<p>“…Dr. William Gravel, that is.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Why… have I been moved? What… the <em>hell</em> is this room? The pain…”</p>\n<p>Dr. Gravel looked his way again with unsettlingly white eyes, belching under his breath, emptily grinning.</p>\n<p>“Ah, well, this is Clipboard Locker three, you see… Didn’t think these just appeared willy nilly outa thin air, didja? A<em>ha</em>,” he laughed hollowly and briefly held up his board in displayed emphasis before licking quickly his fingers in that foulest of fingery quick-licking ticks found in far too many of the most off-putting people, returning them then to vile scrunching and rubbing of what was presumably Barney Blimp’s medical chart.</p>\n<p>“At this point,” he said, chin retreating in another emission, “we moved you here, you see… because there seemed to be a problem when we tried to run your insurance, I’m afraid.”</p>\n<p>“You… what? You… can’t… you can’t do that?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Oh jeez, I’m really sorry Barney, buddy… At this point, I’m afraid we can’t give you anything more for the pain until you answer a few questions for me… Don’t worry, though, we will get it all figured out in no time at all.”</p>\n<p>“…<em>The former General raw and red-eyed as he defended the President</em>…”</p>\n<p>“At this point… I’d like to formalize things, if you don’t mind,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and clicking his ballpoint repeatedly after dismounting it from the board. “Uh… Give me just a moment… uhhuh.”</p>\n<p>“…<em>Good morning, Geoff</em>…”</p>\n<p>The doctor marched around the bed, scooting and flattening himself between the TV cart and the decrepit wall, briefly disappearing behind the cover of a filthy old-fashioned hospital screen to produce a rolling chair with matching white leather upholstery.</p>\n<p>“…<em>The driver, look at this</em>…”</p>\n<p>Both the hinges and the cracking cushion creaked as he sat, leaning at once much too far back, then regaining balance with his lifted legs and a loathsome “<em>whoopsie!</em>” Barney Blimp, still clutching, set to sucking in a great, to-capacity breath.</p>\n<p>“TURN OFF THE FUCKING…” he screamed.</p>\n<p>“<em>Hel</em>lo, aha,” said Dr. Gravel, with his chins and his belching.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Blimp, I am Dr. William Gravel, resident psychiatrist at St. Nicolas. At this point, I’d like to conduct your initial examination interview, if that’s alright with you. How are you feeling today?”</p>\n<p>“Hello, Bill. Turn off the fucking TV please.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>\n<p>“For the love of God, turn off the fucking television… Right <em>there</em>!” yelled Barney, sitting up with all his effort, indicating with both outstretch hands to the blabbering set at his feet, palms pleading toward the ceiling stains, “RIGHT <em>THERE</em>… TURN. IT. OFF.”</p>\n<p>“Gee, Barney…” said Dr. Gravel, following his patient’s desperately distressed eyes, “I can’t really do that at this point, I’m afraid… That TV is part of this whole regimen… You need it! You need it to feel better.” He and his chins belched on his board and again his fingers performed the quick-licking tick. Barney Blimp – having exhausted the energy he had saved in his rage – flopped back in on his unfulfilling pillows, moaning.</p>\n<p>“*We’ve got what looks to be a… Ha ha, well… a miniature *trough* of chili right here in front of us. Wow!&hellip;*”</p>\n<p>“At this point,” belch, licking tick, “I&rsquo;m going to ask you a few questions that may seem a bit silly, but it&rsquo;s important that you try to answer them honestly and accurately, okay? We can laugh about them, no problem, but the actual answers from you need to be serious ones, if you can, okay?”</p>\n<p>“…<em>Yes, that’s an understandable contrast to make, Jack</em>…”</p>\n<p>“Let’s begin with your name. Can you tell me your full name?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Barney… Barry… Blimp,” he answered, clutching his middle again and looking serenely at the front of Theodore Pith’s t-shirt on the TV with just his neck.</p>\n<p>“Excellent, Barney… Okay, now… Today’s date?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Barney?&hellip; The date, buddy.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Saturday… March tenth.”</p>\n<p>“Perfect,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and scribbling with his crude, scratching instrument.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“And, can you tell me where we are now?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Amidst a chorus of agony and new epiphany, Barney laid back flat and began shuffling downward in his bed toward the cart by gyrating his hips.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Barn<em>ey</em>, can you tell me where you are? Maybe what this room is?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Grunting and breathlessly cursing, the shuffling progressed steadily and Barney’s feet soon escaped the floral sheets, exposed toes touching the cold metal cart.</p>\n<p>“…<em>Well, there it is… You’ve got to love that humor!</em>&hellip;”</p>\n<p>“Alrighty, then, why don’t we come back to that one? No problem at all, buddy… How about the President? Can you tell me who the President is right now?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Satisfied with his distance from the box and grimacing, Barney dug in his elbows and pushed against the towering black object of his torture with the gowned-above-the-knees might and unabashed howling of childbirth, tipping it insufficiently at first, then allowing it to swing back against the bed before adding all available gumption to the assisting action of his knees.</p>\n<p>“…<em>What kind of a shirt is that?</em>&hellip;” asked Jaime Jangles in finality as she fell back out of Barney’s sight with the thing, crashing, buzzing, and then entirely quieting, to his short-lived relief.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“<em>Whoopsie!</em>” belched Dr. Gravel.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>On a clear day in the springtime, the United States Air Force Academy just north of Colorado Springs is an unequaled, head-looseningly airy and metallic experience with its acres of flat, entirely rectangular aluminum-covered facilities(fn) devoid of all but the most nominal distinguishing features, low and wide, but architecturally focused to culminate in its famous chapel – the historic purebred brutalist structure at the geographic center of the Cadet Area designed by architect Walter Netsch, who could not have delivered a single more effective symbol of traditionalist American values redressed and repurposed into a gargantuan armored war machine. On this early afternoon, two pair and one threesome of seamless khaki-wrapped Cadets walked measuredly around the intensely reflective white rectangular concrete circuit toward which the chapel doors faced inward and its monolithic presence loomed, smiling more than seemed reasonable in their surroundings, reflecting even more of the unencumbered sun off of their perfectly white teeth up the naturally-bordering hill of the West edge, where Lily Tharp and Theodore Pith leaned their folded forearms against the thick concrete wall of the elevated walkway and squinted(fn) toward the bizarre scene below.</p>\n<p>“I do wonder where they get so much of whatever it is they have,” said Pith.</p>\n<p>“They’re just kids,” replied Lily.</p>\n<p>“Kids with gifted IQs, perfect eyesight, above-average reflexes, and completely neurotypical brain function, yeah.”</p>\n<p>A breeze shifted and spiraled from the first corner of the path from around the hill’s base, 300 yards behind them, buffeting Theodore’s Curls and whipping stray strands about Lily’s bun.</p>\n<p>“I could’ve done it. Probably still could. I’ve heard they never stopped requiring fighter pilots to take Adderall, though.”</p>\n<p>“I believe all’a that. We could go down and ask for a hookup but I think that church must be a complex surveillance apparatus of some kind… I’m surprised they let us roam around this close, unsupervised.”</p>\n<p>A red-tailed hawk’s shadow panned along the bottom edge of their entranced vision and they both looked up – hands to their foreheads for shade – just in time to see its splayed feather wingspan descend behind the far side of the chapel, out of sight.</p>\n<p>“Do you actually want to learn to fly? I could pay for it, you know,” Pith asked, glancing imprecisely in her more sunlit direction.</p>\n<p>“You’d just demand that I fly you everywhere.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“That’s not true in the slightest, but I would definitely expect a ridealong or two during which you allow me to screw around on the radio.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been anywhere like this.”</p>\n<p>“It’s like a future caste of technocatholic elites built an industrial Eden on the top of a mountain above the clouds.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, my Uncle said he was an officer, but I don’t think he could miss mentioning this place.”</p>\n<p>“Ya know… it reminds one a lot of-”</p>\n<p>“Workin’ on it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, thanks. It’s just a really exciting prospect to restore something like that… Open it up to exhibits, even? I would be the God of hams for the rest of time.”</p>\n<p>“And if, indeed, I am able to actually acquire for you the ownership of what was not-so-long-ago top-secret acreage containing top-secret equipment within a foreign nationally-sealed exclusion zone, <em>I</em> will be <em>your</em> God.”</p>\n<p>“That’s very true.”</p>\n<p>“Though technically, they’ve only continued to maintain the zone out that far because it’s become a wildlife refuge.”</p>\n<p>“Which would be even more difficult to swing were it legally classified as such.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, well… If it happens, it happens.”</p>\n<p>Four of the walkers had departed the circuit, but the group of three was having another go, one of whom was walking backwards, toe-to-heel in front of them, telling an animated story with his napkincap in his fist. Theodore Pith inhaled deeply and cupped his hands into a cone around his mouth, which he pointed straight at the gaggle and <em>screeched</em> at an inhumanly high frequency for just a quarter second before jerking around to look up the hill behind him, enacting bewilderment. He saw the sound had distracted and slowed the Cadets and turned their smiles to mild puzzlement.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go find a drink somewhere,” he said.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>Chief Technical Officer Peter Built had planned to be unreachable for at least an entire workweek – if not eternity – after the fateful Thursday when the billionaire and Barney Blimp had made a joke of his career and shit on his conference table in a single morning, but come noon on Monday, he woke up in his bathtub – pruned and badly chemically burned from the bleach he’d poured in at the end of the previous evening – to a backlog of incoherent emails, texts, and voicemail messages – mostly from Madge Teeth – in which she sounded far more ecstatically surprised than he’d ever actually heard from a human being, though completely and entirely incoherent, as if she’d taken a humongous dose of Peyote. When he managed to log in to the office chat server on his smartphone with what remained of the dissolving flesh of his thumbs, he was whole-body astonished to find the routine passive aggressive cross-department correspondence and bullshit Associate question volume he’d have expected by this time on every Monday before this one for as long as he could remember.</p>\n<p>After a brief and frank internal debate between his extreme exasperation with existence and immense curiosity over how and why the office he’d seen totally annihilated just four days before appeared to have returned to normal work, he resolved that he was much too pruned and uncomfortable to kill himself, so he began upon the task of gathering up the layers of drooping red skin in his arms to escape from the acrid tub, sloshing the terrible fluid about the linoleum as he stepped heroically onto the large pile of smoldering ashes of the self-help books he’d burned on the tile during his strange last-night rituals. Stopping by the master closet, he walked in to find it totally emptied of both his and Ingrid’s belongings – including hangers – and containing only in its very center her pet tarantula, Bo, who looked solemn.</p>\n<p>He’d even left the gas stovetop on, hoping to leave Earth in a fireball, but the burners had been inexplicably lit without any evidence of combustion, so they’d accomplished nothing but running up the bill all night. After some seriously effortful nude recollection and a few swigs of isopropyl alcohol from under the kitchen sink, he remembered one hateful diving trip with his in-laws in the summer of 2007 and dashed across the house, dripping to the garage, where his car was still parked in the far space, <em>thank Gourd</em>, though heavily vandalized. Ingrid, he assumed, had used the can of John Deere Yellow spraypaint he’d bought years ago (intending to touch up a large scratch on the flank of a riding mower which they no longer owned) to write <em>S C R U B</em> across the already-filthy vehicle’s left side. This indecency, however, he barely registered. Instead, he approached the space under the high shelf in the far corner and jumped repeatedly into the plywood wall, grabbing for the ratty, disfigured cardboard box resting atop it. It inched forward as he leapt again and again, heaving and sweating naked bleach droplets until the dusty-ass hunk finally fell upon him, breaking open upon its contact with the concrete to reveal a filthy, cobweb-covered wetsuit.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>It was an amalgamation of partial Limon truths, now – images of faces, landmarks in different seasons, and fragments of specific memories colliding with each other in continually-upended attempts to align cohesively: Leona, Lexie, and Leo smoking ditchweed from a one-hitter on a cloudy Fall evening at the y-lot; confronting Liam after class with Lazarus about the cruelty in shooting his dad’s cows with a BB gun for sport; riding a flea-infested queen mattress towed behind Lexi’s boyfriend’s loud little pickup truck through suburbia like a raft; picking up a free piano from a classified ad only to destroy it in the park with its own legs the same day, <em>screaming</em> in a frenzy for the camcorder; his quaint, speedy mother – either completely understanding his time of need to explore and dissect his selves, or simply… not, but always as present as she could possibly be. In retrospect, it was always much more of the first.</p>\n<p>Gradually, sounds somewhere between familiar music and familiar voices joined with the collage to produce an immensely powerful, unexpected ache which Barney Blimp had not experienced in so long he’d all but forgotten its sensation. It was deepening like vertigo, but warm – a sore release. It lapped up his heart and ran down his limbs until his toes buzzed before it all circled back to his nose as its focal point, unleashing huge waves of nostalgia on the rich anomalous presence of his favorite smell: wood-smoked barbecue in the late-evening Fall chill, which he both celebrated and desperately mourned because it could never, ever be recreated as it was supposed to be – *with *those it was supposed to be. He began to grow quickly angry at his subjection to this ache unnecessarily.</p>\n<p><em>And then there was light</em> and the dream’s smell was replaced by the imponderous and much less activating odor of diluted disinfectant as Barney caught his bearings enough to realize he was back upstairs in his original room at St. Nicholas, but the television was gone, and his remaining abdominal discomfort was tiny and dull. A thunderstorm was just concluding its business outside his window, and for a moment he felt confident that he would be able to coax the pressure in his throat to the surface and finally get some long-overdue crying out of the way, but he lost his grip and it slipped curtly back into his familiar state of generalized rage.</p>\n<p>The Hell Tablet from before had been replaced on the mounted swinging tray by his own smartphone, which had even been plugged into an outlet to charge. For a moment, he considered if <em>Good Morning America</em>, Dr. Gravel, and Clipboard Room #3 had been nothing more than a wild fever dream – perhaps even Theodore Pith and his destructive office breakdown! Picking up the handset, though, he realized that it was not his, but in fact an unused example of its successive generation that had been restored from whatever was left of his old device after he pillaged MapQuest. Unlocking it, he was made immediately uneasy noticing that eight whole days had passed since the last time he remembered being conscious, and even more so by the first email in his inbox.</p>\n<p>To: <a href=\"mailto:barn@mapquest.com\">barn@mapquest.com</a><br>\nFrom: <a href=\"mailto:t@pi.th\">t@pi.th</a><br>\nDate: Friday, 03/16/2018 1647<br>\nSubject: Get well soon/updates on the future!</p>\n<p>Barney!</p>\n<p>I’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to be introduced formally.

Pith</p>\n<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>\n<p>By the Monday after <em>The Incident</em>, MapQuest’s new Chief Operating Officer, Lily Tharp had remotely arranged the significantly expedited insurance appraisal, cleanup, refinishing, repainting, refurnishing, remodeling, and re-equipment of the 1555 Baker St. office with modernized server architecture, desktop machines, and state-of-the-art Enterprise-class laser printers from her smartphone on the road. The space’s new look was a reimagination of the previous design, drawing from the same color palette, but darkened and shifted, and its haphazardly speckled light wood deleted in favor of matte black sound-absorbing and soft-touch alcantara. Arriving minutes after sunrise, Lily was the first to experience the results of her work, and the smell of new paint combined with the young day’s light to present a rejuvenated MapQuest that wasn’t any more hip than the dated old layout, but for her felt significantly less like a graveyard, at least.</p>\n<p>Both the already-negligent CEO and CFO had officially vanished with the last scraps of the budget AOL had been throwing the company quarterly, deleting their LinkedIns, locking their other social accounts, and dropping off Tharp’s immediate radar, which was – including what they’d legally stolen – so inconsequential that she’d delegated away their severance because she couldn’t be bothered to retain any memories of their existence. In less than a week, she had become MapQuest’s senior executive *and *completely redesigned its working environment. She had commandeered Peter’s corner office and expanded it dramatically so that every employee and guest would be immediately greeted by her steady, deep blue eyes above the immense span of her black desk, full-on upon entering the work floor and know immediately who it belonged to.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>For the first time since the Zuckerberg scandal (as far as he could remember,) Lenny Lather arose, sober, before 10 on Monday morning to an empty <em>Nice, Big</em> in complete clarity. Refraining even from the French press, he departed the great house in sneakers and khaki shorts only two minutes after rising, bound for the corner diner a mile and a half down the road toward town. As he walked through the chaff on the sidewalk from yesterday’s first mass-mowing of the year, he meticulously turned over each of the major events and decisions in his recent past which had led him to destitution, living off of a young billionaire – financially and energetically – in the middle of Wisconsin, rapidly approaching fifty and his honest-to-goodness <em>last</em> last chance to redeem his career on the promise of a good story which his subject made sure he was always too high to write. And this was the *second consecutive *variation on this most unlikely of themes: young billionaires ruining his career.</p>\n<p>At the diner, he gulped down eggs, toast, and four glasses of water before setting off over the same sidewalk upon which he came. *All it would take *for him to actually get the story on Theodore Pith – the young man who’d treated him like a stray dog with amusing habits – was the slightest bit of moderation, and he’d have a first-person account in the most intimate detail of how this reckless, absurdist young mogul lived, and he couldn’t possibly be more primed for public distaste – much less for accountability to the law. As he walked past the driveway upon which a round retiree was waxing his cabin cruiser for the new season, Lenny Lather committed to becoming relevant and respected again and made no motion to return the boatist’s friendly wave. Now, he had absolutely nothing to lose, and no excuse for hesitation or journalistic piety. Upon his arrival back at the house, he ignited a hot mid-day inferno in the study’s vast fireplace and methodically fed every single jumbled page of his notes from the past year to the flames. When it was all finished and burning, he sat erect in the red leather armchair with the thick curtains drawn over the tall windows in only the light from the blaze. Still in his sneakers and pouring sweat down his legs, he looked deep into the heart of the roar with a Parker between his fingers and a blank steno on his knee.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith arrived at the Baker St. office swooping in an all-black suit a few minutes after twelve o’clock, as the 20 employees of the new MapQuest who’d mustered the courage to show up on its first day had only then paused their work to partake timidly in the five-star catered Greek lunch which Lily Tharp had insisted upon in the common area. Only Madge Teeth had thought to bring her new laptop to the bar, on which she ruthlessly pounded out email after email into its very clicky new keys as she munched on quiche. Most of those brave enough to have remained worked in Customer Support, and were therefore most accustomed to static workstations, but upon their arrival throughout the morning – it took many varying amounts of self-soothing to must the courage to return to the office so soon – new desktop machines awaited each on (or in) their assigned spaces, along with new full-sized laptops, still in box. Two of the rigs still needed to be properly set up, and the boss had been expected at lunchtime, so the crowd was understandably antsy and they chewed like starving mules as he and his top-combed bobbing blood curl strut into view, quickly slowing at their obvious fright.</p>\n<p>“Now what is <em>wrong</em>, bunch?”</p>\n<p>He spread his legs wide, rested his hands on his hips and pivoted slowly to look in every downturned face from his own frown before abruptly sliding the two strides to the office’s new big-door stainless steel fridge and produced from the pocket of its yet-to-be-cooling door, a seven-eighths-full bottle of Macallan 18, which he <em>plunked</em> down on the wood short-bar, raising his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>“Every one of you is going to take a swig of this, right now,” he ordered, looking between them again.</p>\n<p>“Uh, I don’t drink, and it’s like one PM on a Monday,” Madge said, returning her attention to her computer.</p>\n<p>A few murmured chuckles played through the largely stool-sat crowd.</p>\n<p>“Fine – you’re the only one that doesn’t need it but I’m not kidding… Everybody needs to come up here right now and take at least a single drink of this… I can see it in your faces.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Look, I’m sorry… I know this is the worst possible way to meet your new boss, but there are rare moments in life when all etiquette may be forgone in the face of evident truth, and the truth is…. Evidently, all of you need a goddamned drink!”</p>\n<p>Real grins and more voluminous <em>har har</em>s, now. Shad Balch – MapQuest’s last remaining web developer and the only of the crowd Pith yet knows by name – dismounts his stool and tugs the front of his sweater down, shaking his head lazily, chuckling as he arrives across the bar and is handed the whole bottle, dipping his arm and widening his eyes for a moment.</p>\n<p>“Jez,” he said, tipping the whole crowd – including Madge, even – into full-on, red-faced, pneumatic hammer-like cackling. Finally, others slowly move to line up behind Shad, who’s timidly raising the bottle’s attitude, sniffing and face-scrunching, but still giggling enough that his unsteadiness unfold’s Pith’s arms to the ready out of instinct as he cringes in view of the pitiful spectacle before him. He’s just inhaling to complain when Shad finally goes for two moderate gulps, his entire upper face theatrically squeezed shut with his eyes even still when he drops it and exhales twice as loud as was necessary and sets the bottle hastily down in front of Pith to scurry off like a 7-year-old who’s just been made to take his cough medicine.</p>\n<p>“Oh come on! That’s the best stuff there is!”</p>\n<p>Pith rather firmly explains that the communion method is the most efficient for a moderately sized group like theirs to ingest alcohol from a single bottle when the support tech fourth in line twice insists that they “should just pass it around,” actually blurting out “you’re fired” but catching it quick to laugh it off as a tease.</p>\n<p>“She’s pregnant and I’m her attorney so square up, bitch,” barked Lily upon her arrival from her office, abruptly silencing the bits of chatter that had sprouted up in the line and moving all eyes to follow her as she nonchalantly bent down to grab a vine of purple grapes out of the loose grocery bag under the bar.</p>\n<p>“You wanna check in now, T?” she asked, rinsing them off.(fn)</p>\n<p>“Absolutely,” said Theodore, setting the scotch down gingerly on the touchpad of Madge’s laptop.</p>\n<p>“No exceptions – even pregnancy,” he said.</p>\n<p>Theodore shut Lily’s office door behind him so they could allow themselves a single, consolidated laugh. He clasped his hands behind his back and faced the framed, skillfully blown-up *Dixie Chicks *poster she’d already managed to have hung in the dead center of the new black paint on the far wall from her desk. She sat and wrestled for a moment with the computer display before freeing its base from an oversized brass hinge buried in the black wood desk. Pith began swaying side-to-side on his hips ever so slightly, still admiring.</p>\n<p>“Shad Balch,” he said.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Shaaad <em>Balch,</em>” she replied.</p>\n<p>“Shadbalch… <em>BALCH</em>.”</p>\n<p>Breaking the spell upon him by the Goddesses on the dark wall, he turned to find the loveseat in the corner was the only seating yet to arrive, so he sat on its armrest, crossing his arms and legs.</p>\n<p>“So the post,” began Lily, appearing as if tiny, peeping at him from behind her huge desk, a dozen and a half feet away.(fn)</p>\n<p>“… It’s just all blatant lies.”</p>\n<p>“Well not *all *of it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Not even <em>most</em> of it, actually. Something like half.”</p>\n<p>“Half.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Oh, you are aware that absolutely *no one *reads those, right? Except journalists, really, and we’re not doing anything the tech magazines want to hear about, trust me.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“It looks like shit just there on its own.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, well, there’s not going to be anybody around to build any cushions physical <em>or</em> digital in the next 20 minutes, so we may as well just call it a fucking devblog for now.”</p>\n<p>“A devblog.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Yeah, which should also keep anyone and everyone away but the most tedious, maniacal journalist.”</p>\n<p>“What about art and design?”</p>\n<p>“Well… Even <em>Shad Balch</em> is sufficient for a <em>devblog</em>, but you should never, ever worry about visuals until the very last moment, these days. There are a billion starving, extremely talented young web and graphic designers within inches of you at any time. When we close further in on that point, we’ll toss a worm out over the lake and everything will be bid down by the competition and whipped up in no time at all to a quality beyond expectation – even delivered and backed up before it even hits the water.”</p>\n<p>“Sounds good to me.”</p>\n<p>“Just make sure to pay them way too much, okay? You could probably multiply their fee by 10 and it wouldn’t add up to a quarter of what we’d end up paying a designhouse to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Alrighty.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Pith leaned back and let his torso fall across the loveseat’s other armrest – head up, feet dangling.</p>\n<p>“Speaking of design… you fucking nailed the look of this place.”</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>After a moment of silence between the two, they felt something dense scrape into metal somewhere below them in the building without warning – Lily could feel a sickening crunch from the floor with her feet, and Theodore noticed the office door shake. They looked at each other and then over the other’s shoulder, each fairly certain they’d correctly identified the sound they’d heard moving away from- and then back toward them, heavily muffled from somewhere outside was that of a tortured compact car’s engine held to its rev limiter. Pith was struggling preposterously to escape the loveseat by violently rocking back and forth in order to build up enough perpetual momentum to propel his heavy end over the armrest when the dreadful noise began approaching again – though <em>much</em> more alarmingly rapid than before. Lily hustled out of the office containing her struggling boss and found a street-facing window just in time to see a flash of dusty metallic maroon disappear into ground level of the building, two floors beneath her as she felt and heard the impact – an almost cartoonish squeak at a deafening volume – before the building’s unsettling reeling.</p>\n<p>She closed her eyes and waiting in the settling dust to hear screaming, but then recalled the last business to leave that lot – a restaurant called “Chicken Cunts” – had finished clearing out the previous Tuesday, and so was able to find able again to take slow, deep breaths freely. A total of only four other Questers were curious enough to make their way to the window by the time she opened them again, spinning back toward her office for her phone while acknowledging and reassuring their grim murmured expletives. Theodore Pith emerged from the doorframe as she approached.</p>\n<p>“<em>Whuh</em>oh. What was it?”</p>\n<p>“I think it was a car but I’m going to call. There’s nothing down there right now, so I’m sure it’s fine.”</p>\n<p>“Sure. I’m gonna pop down ‘n have a look.”</p>\n<p>Nodding, they parted, Pith headed for the same window quizzingly, noticing the weary eyes turned his way, seeking an answer.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure everything’s fine, guys. I’ll be right back,” he shouted, extending his fingers back at them and once waving them vertically downward as he made his expediate way toward the lobby. He rounded the new, clinical stainless steel desk at reception through the door and the two dormant elevators outside for the stairwell without hearing anything one would generally expect shortly after their building has just been forcibly assaulted by an entire automobile. Double-down the steps he went through the drafty air of the well and its everpresent chlorine-scented breezes which opened him to the secondary hall – empty, still lit, alarms silent, and appearing not at all out of sorts. Over the navy blue carpet, swiveling his head between both the dark doorways of the maintenance and electrical rooms, around an L-joint, where he began to see indicators of destruction behind the <em>CHICKEN CUNTS</em> stickered logo on the plate-glass door at the end: chunks of plaster and a thin green stream slithering down the white tile.</p>\n<p>Through the door – which was supposed to be locked by building policy – he saw that the event had been no cataclysm, really – a little red car had simply broken part-way through the West wall, failing even to compromise it enough to bring the section down completely, so it was snugly surrounded by the hole it punched, back wheels remaining in the Great Outdoors against the foundation’s edge. The vehicle, however, was a loss, no doubt – its nose badly grizzled, frothily steaming and ticking. Pith stepped through the crunching debris to better search the far driver’s side and was sharply startled by the gigantic hairy brown spider sitting on the roof – sufficiently to hoot and whoop to himself. He noticed the aggravated artistry across the distressed flank and an oblong creature in the left seat, contorted in a position his eyes had extreme difficulty comprehending, despite having a long moment to process the sight as Pith squinted and tilted his head.</p>\n<p>“Hey scrub!” he shouted, to no observable response.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>He crunched forward one step and pounded with his fist on the window between himself and the filthy bulges of the creature, yet it remained unstirring. He reached for the door’s black composite handle and lifted it gingerly, releasing the door in a <em>pop</em> as it released the pile of post-apocalyptic maritime recreation to roll clumsily onto the floor, where Theodore recognized it as former MapQuest COO Peter Built after a moment.</p>\n<p>“Heya! Mr. Built!”</p>\n<p>Peter half opened his eyes at the ceiling and exhaled a groan, awkwardly shifting his cruddy hands to his forehead.</p>\n<p>“Jesus man…” Pith chuckled, leaning against the wreck and glancing nervously at the unbothered Bo resting atop it.</p>\n<p>Peter Built continued his inverbal expressions of discomfort and blinked repeatedly, rolling a few inches right and left, but abruptly halted to inhale sharply and shoot his puffy, reddened eyes at Pith’s with great mania.</p>\n<p>“<em>HA</em>!” he screamed, contact unwavering.</p>\n<p>“Are you okay..? Peter?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“PHEWah!” Built roared, at once leaping up and into a squeaky sprint for the former Chicken Cunts rear exit from which Theodore had come, who stood, following the sight as he burst through its glass, stumbled, cackling to one knee, yet continued his apparently unphased forward momentum until he was gone. He looked to the spider and then back again, wondering amusedly aloud under his breath until the big bug caught his instinctive attention when he started to wander about, zigzagging as he tacked down the far slope of the roof and around a building puddle of lime green antifreeze in pursuit of his companion.</p>\n<p>Lily Tharp had finally convinced the building manager on her fifth try that she was <em>not</em> a robocaller,(fn) but in fact the top executive in charge of building matters at the Baker St. lot’s largest remaining tenant by far after he’d picked up four consecutive calls only to scream “<em>ROBOCALL ILLEGAL! ROBOCALL ILLEGAL</em>!” repeatedly, presumably with his phone’s receiver at the farthest possible distance from his ear until the other party (whom we know to be Ms. Tharp) would disconnect the call. Only by preparing herself for the fifth so that she bested his volume with her own rapidly repeated bellowing of “<em>STOP IT! HEY! STOP.</em>” had she finally persuaded him to listen enough to hear her identify herself moments before she glimpsed a blurred black tube shooting by the doorway from her periphery and heard rapid oscillating <em>pats</em> on the new carpet.</p>\n<p>“Yes, this is Lily from MapQuest at 1555 Baker St.-”</p>\n<p>“Uh huh.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah! I was calling about something serious you should prob-”</p>\n<p>“Okay, okay… You <em>need</em> to tell me… <em>exactly… what’s… happening</em>, okay?”</p>\n<p>“Ye-”</p>\n<p>“…<em>exactly</em>.”</p>\n<p>Lily got on her feet to peer out her doorway both ways, still holding the phone to her ear.</p>\n<p>“I understand. I will try… to be as precise as I can, okay?”</p>\n<p>She saw no tube, but did notice Maggie at the bar across the way was looking the direction of the restroom hallway, failing to stifle her giggling with her right wrist to her upper lip.</p>\n<p>“Going on fifteen minutes ago now, a car-”</p>\n<p>“Okay that’s great! Because you know people call me *angry *with all these <em>problems</em> like ‘a pipe burst,’ or ‘the shower is overflowing and I think the sink’s clogged, but you know I just divorced my husband of eight years and shaved the fuckin’ thing for the first time since,’ or ‘<em>help me help mee</em>, my cat’s in the microwave and I just set it to cook for <em>two hours</em>,’ and always with this *anger *in their *voices *like I have time for that! Like I wanna hear <em>you</em>, complaining about ya stupid life in the middle of the goddamn day! Like I don’t have nothin’ betta to do!”</p>\n<p>Maggie made the mistake of glancing over and locking eyes with Lily, who firmly asked her with the extreme altitude to which she raised her eyebrows to take immediate care of whatever the hell <em>that</em> was.</p>\n<p>“It’s just that <em>a car</em> has driven into our building!”</p>\n<p>“Oh my god! What? A <em>car</em>?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, a few minutes ago, I saw a car drive through the wall where Chicken Sluts was.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“*Into *the side of the building, oh my god!”</p>\n<p>Maggie was on the move on the tube’s trail, head unnaturally forward, leading the way to the back, her arms unnaturally still as she plodded with a black earbud cable bouncing on her neck. Lily leaned out the opening to watch her round the corner before Theodore Pith startled her from behind with his muffled chuckle as he tried to nudge past, but realized the transgression and mouthed <em>sorry</em>, clicking his tongue and making his way back to the loveseat. Lily decided the best course of action in the face of her rambling phone contact was to leave the phone on speaker with him so that she could investigate herself.</p>\n<p>“He knows who we are… try and tell him what’s going on if he ever stops talkin, or just hang up. It probably doesn’t matter.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him and pointed at the handset as she switched it over, placed it down on the desk, back-first, and whirled out of the office once more, nose in the air.</p>\n<p>“Oh my god… How stupid can you be?! Where do all these idiots come from? You drive your car through an <em>office building</em>?! In the middle of the damned city? Who the <em>hell</em> taught them anything? I swear to god… I just don’t know what to say sometimes, you know. I don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to do… And all these angry people call me and all they really want is somebody to yell at, but it’s my job, you know. I’ve gotta answer the phone and listen to all these every day – can’t understand them half the time – gotta listen to all these maniacs scream about lead in the pipes or asbestos in the walls because their allergies get bad when it’s <em>they themselves</em> who go out every Sunday to pick up <em>another</em> dusty-ass wardrobe off the curb so they can blog about *refurbishing *an <em>antique</em>, and by that they mean covering it in some $50 bright peppermint paint from Lowe’s they find out later doesn’t <em>dry</em> on wood, so all they’ve done is make a piece-a-trash old wardrobe so ugly and *visibly *sticky to the touch that it never even breaks a $40 bid on eBay, so they sell it to their Mom when she comes up for Easter, who’ll end up dumping it on *her *curb before Jesus is risen even one more time, and the whole damned cycle of wasted money will repeat again some other mother’s daughter arrives on a Sunday to bring it home in her Volvo who’s allergies it will <em>also</em> exacerbate, and <em>guess who</em> they’re gonna call to threaten with legal action?”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Pith recognized the pause and hurriedly inhaled to reply, but was a moment too late.</p>\n<p>“I-”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t know about this. I’m so damned tired of it all… but ya know somebody’s gotta do it and it must be way worse out on the coasts…”</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-v\">Chapter V</h2>\n<p>In the definitively matriarchal, mostly Germanic travel hub of Limon, Colorado, Barney, Barry, and Betty-Anne Blimp had begun the 1990s in a position to thrive. Barry, a Vietnam veteran with a chipped canine, an inherited family hog farm, and “crazy eyes” was headed down a new life avenue at forty-two in partial convenience store ownership with his best high school bud Tommy and a few of Tommy’s less-than-virtuous associates, which was – in such a prospective intersection of byways: the Kyle Railroad, Interstate 70, and proximity to the State’s two dominant metropolises – the <em>bee’s knees</em>. Marriage to his third wife, Betty-Anne had cemented his newfound potential satisfactorily enough to be granted a business loan from the lone regional banking chain the same week their first and only child was birthed, snipped, and dunked in Lutheran from-concentrate Holy Water.</p>\n<p>Barney’s mother was an embodiment of this Brisk American Process – never doing anything without haste; denouncing even in middleage the necessity (or existence) of <em>The Long Game</em>. Despite her pace, she had found in Librarianism a place of belonging on her first go – graduating from the University of Denver with a Masters in Library Science at just 19 after testing in before she could legally drive thanks to the diligence (and yes, the speed) of her homeschooling. If the Limon Memorial Library could even remotely afford a memorial statue, a towering Betty-Anne would surely grace its grounds now, brass-in-motion with her youthful black curls as near as feasibly perpendicular in a trail behind her form, as the institution owed its entire existence to her ruthless wit and otherworldly, naturally-amphetamined energy. If one took it upon themselves to speculate, they might suggest that it was indeed her speed that grayed, then bleached her curls white within a single year; that the circumstances surrounding Barney’s creation were from most planes of analysis quite tardy, and that Barry – while perhaps the most appropriately quick match she could’ve made – was a bad decision; that mothering a child after one’s hair has entirely silvered was uncouth and unnatural – much less after it had wholly <em>whitened</em>. One is free to indulge these speculations, but Betty-Anne never traveled in an even remotely slow enough velocity to hear or ponder or engage with them, right up to her Judgment Day before her Maker, in fact, whom she no doubt found aggravatingly dull.</p>\n<p>It’s largely forgotten by those who’ve traversed the class divide in the 21st century that childhood in Barney’s era had changed little since that of his parents’ in diet: afternoon cartoons, ketchup, macaroni, hotdogs, and the lot – albeit a bit more processed. There were still Marvel superheroes, arcades, billion-piece, tediously-assembled model cars &amp; aeros, and Little League. The difference – according to the retrospective ponderings of the architectural Boomers themselves – was in the way Merit &amp; Achievement were processed. They say it was the cushion of encouragement and their own elimination of Loss – as factor, variable, and fact of the reality which they crafted for their kin – that fucked up entirely their children’s potential ability to climb above it. In Barney Blimp’s case, however, the fucking was certainly of more nuanced origin, as “losing” was defined differently, with an even greater weight in his mind than his parents’ generation could have possibly imagined.</p>\n<p>Barney never lost in track, baseball, football, or basketball because he never lowered himself to compete in such worldly things. He found most of his 200-odd graduating classmates lacking in luster, but in the blossoming neo-puritanical world of online gaming, Blimp had the pick of the globe, and from preadolescence onward he spent his time virtually among all manner of millennial punks learning how to challenge himself – in fact, learning <em>above all</em> to be competitive. The ideal gamer in the early days was a brotherly roughhouser who competed even in cooperation, regardless of their success, and the glorified <em>Shithead</em> persona sat well with the jaded group of five highschool friends who adopted and eventually socialized him.</p>\n<p>East by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of the Rockies, the meat of Colorado is – as its nearest Easterly neighbor is so notoriously – <em>fucking flat</em>. In daylight, one&rsquo;s field of vision – one’s entire world – is constricted by the limitations of Earth&rsquo;s curvature, which dooms their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of Barney’s home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions. Over years and decades of existing in such a small place throughout such a formative time, human beings like Blimp and his peers live with a profoundly specific spatial psyche, boundaried absolutely. In a town like Limon, it can be tempting – for a visitor – to sift through the longtime occupants according to how they choose (or – depending on one’s choice position within the nature/nurture argument – are <em>predisposed</em>) to respond to these boundaries. It is not unreasonable to say – timidly, anyway – that <em>most</em> find comfort within them, and – much less timidly – to say that they lead overwhelmingly more satisfied lives. Others – like Barney’s <em>Limon Six</em> – end up classically claustrophobic and tend to spend significant time and energy in their formation of abrasive relationships with both physical and psychological bounds. An integral compounding effect on this aspirational affliction could perhaps be attributed to their Boomer parents and their intermittent, vague insistences like <em>you can be anything you want</em>, <em>you can do anything you set your mind to</em>, and their infinite variations.</p>\n<p>The Blimps traveled phenomenally often for a Limon family but never incurred the notion – as long as travel was within their wants and means – to leave North America. Nevertheless, young Barney’s primary preferences for any given road trip were simply for the exploration of altitude; by distant or traversed mountains – by far the most bewitching – and commercial flight, when it was afforded. Whether by backseat or Boeing, the perception of distance enabled by proximity to more diverse typography was nothing less than a treat and his own continent’s allotment seemed plenty. It was these higher experiences that provided him a penetrating catalyst of the sort of ethereal meditation comprehendible only by those who’ve yet to develop past a certain age; the sort which many seek in a plethora of desperations until they’re able to accept its loss. The edged flirtation of Earth with sky were the elemental constants he’d be forever doomed to seek. For the lucky Most, however, the altitudes are not so relentlessly haunting and the six-mile planet is rarely insufficient, but the curiouser of them are universally bound with the whole by their want for understanding that Other aspirational itch as the occupants of each pole are with one another, inevitably, regardless of how fervently they happen to reflect upon the decider.</p>\n<p>The inevitable binding was also for the others of the <em>Six</em> – Leona, Leo, Liam, Lazarus, and Lexie – out of their collectively loosening grip on the special Magic in each, as many or most friendships are, and together they observed in themselves and one another the development of their internal compulsion to find a suitable replacement, and – when at their best – maintained an audit of its power. Most of the instances of need did not come when it felt feasible to fill them with literal wandering as they do not for all but those few with unlimited resources. Farming or service-funded families raise children who must smoke weed and/or drink cheap beer in bulk as their world darkens and squishes, and so <em>The Limon Six</em> of Limon Junior-Senior High School entered their stoner stage shortly after their original congregation, when Barney was fifteen and so wholeheartedly, insularly elitist that his preferred external self-projection was of generalized insanity – though of the least manageably interesting variety – in order to discourage any and all contact with as broad a portion of his peers as possible.</p>\n<p>The fallibility of young Barney Blimp’s plan was his own innate desire for companionship, which 1) prevented the scheme from ever being <em>truly</em> wholehearted and 2) necessitated input from other perspectives, as the execution of any human intention will, thereby contradictorily arranging himself to fail. Lazarus, the Junior – the eldest of the lot – was predisposed to target Barney’s person at lunch hour as a thoroughly weird, but nevertheless compulsively social young man. It was only September when he one Wednesday sat down across from Blimp and immediately began discussing amateur radio operation and its untapped potential among American secret societies, unprompted.</p>\n<p>“So if the Masons are *not *a secret society,” he began, “why is it that they specifically developed secret methods of identifying one another in public and – really – what even *defines *a ‘secret society’ if not its investment in the development of secret methodologies for its participants’ intra-identification, anyway?”</p>\n<p>Barney stopped chewing with a mouthful of his daily one-dollar ham sandwich and bored his eyes into Lazarus’ resting thumbs. In response, they began vigorously twiddling straightaway.</p>\n<p>“Of course, they made sure to place their symbology everywhere, which I would imagine is probably pretty fun. I wonder if they just screen *National Treasure *on repeat for regular meetings, these days. I would for sure put in for that.”</p>\n<p>Cheeks still bulging, Barney Blimp conceded to full, unabridged eye contact with the weariness of ten millennia.</p>\n<p>“Dude, I’m definitely going to become a Free Fucking Mason, but I’m going to modernize their whole shit. Ham radio, you know – probably the most equally-obscured community for the general populace, equally obsessed with ciphers, and *certainly *the only respective equals in socially anti-social activity for old white men with Asperger’s.”</p>\n<p>A Freshman eyebrow was raised; the Freshman chewing, resumed, and the genius of The Junior Lazarus thought it would have a go at a bit of baity ignorance.</p>\n<p>“I mean, if we all really wanted walkie talkies for our treehouse clubs in Elementary school, then it would only make sense to launch the Masons onto the UHF band, right?”</p>\n<p>“VHF,” said Barney through two-day-old pork and peeled-away cheddar. “UHF is for TVs, radar, and cellular phones; <em>vee h eff</em> is ham radio.”</p>\n<p>Lazarus bowed his head, smiled, and faced forward his palms, and thus – in the chemically vomit-scented lunchroom of Limon Junior-Senior High School – the socialization of Barney Blimp began with a bid to modernize the American Freemasons which – if pursued – would’ve proved to be in vain, for by then, in 2003, almost all of the membership had Hotmail accounts. Liam Libel – a Freshman that year, like Barney and by a wide berth the dirtiest of the <em>Six</em> – did not, but he *did *proudly maintain a subscription to *Reason *Magazine and communicated exclusively in savagely relentless Libertarian shouts. After his particularly-troubled World History teacher developed a gasoline drinking habit and fell tremendously ill over Winter break, Liam’s class was absorbed into Blimp’s, which was not much trouble logistically for such a moderately-sized student body, but <em>was</em> from day 1 significant trouble for Barney and his surrounding peers.</p>\n<p>The new, consolidated 10:33AM World History block totaled thirty-three students, who were doing their best to <em>physically</em> and <em>spatially</em> consolidate as the last remaining teacher of World History employed at Limon Junior-Senior High School introduced himself.</p>\n<p>“Hello hello hello, welcome welcome,” cooed the diminutive man in that manner which only secondary educators do.</p>\n<p>“New folks, I’m Mr. Drake – hello hello hello and <em>wel</em>come back… Yes, sorry about the space… It looks like everybody’s doing a great job… Good job managing… This is only for a few weeks, don’t worry… Yes, please do your best to settle in… Yes, hello hello hello, you’re in the right place! Welcome welcome welcome <em>back</em>… I’m Mr. Drake.</p>\n<p>“Before we get started with the curriculum for this semester… It won’t be all that different from what it would’ve been if… And I promise you it won’t be further complicated if and when we move to new rooms, of course, so don’t worry about that… I just wanted to talk about a few policies specific to <em>my</em> class for the new folks… A brush up for the rest of you, of course, he he…”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake hobbled all around his desk, the projector, then to the door, which he unpropped with his right moccasin and began to close but reconsidered with an audible <em>hm</em> and shuffled awkwardly to open and prop again with a kick of his <em>left</em> moccasin, mumming <em>hm</em> again, hobbling his way to the thermostat, which he dramatically leaned back, then forwards, then back again to examine, adjusting his glasses and wedging his right hand flat against his kidney to form a tea kettle handle. He looked that way at it for a few seconds before he attempted to begin another thought, aloud.</p>\n<p>“<em>Aaaaaand</em> we’re just going ta… mmhmm, so it looks like… It looks like… I’m going to keep this turned down just so ah… We’re going to keep the thermostat turned down for now… I think there are enough of us to keep it quite warm in here… Of co-… Ah… Of course, if anybody starts to get especially chilly… Chilly, just let me know.”</p>\n<p>“So!” he said, turning to the squirming, now mildly claustrophobic class for the first time, folding his glasses again.</p>\n<p>“I want to begin by talking about the <em>future</em> a little bit, if that’s okay with everybody… Our terrible future! In which we will all be <em>ruled</em> by these little things!” He produced a scuffed silver flipphone from the black leather holster on his belt.</p>\n<p>“Even now, the common man is surrounded by so many things he just cannot understand. His cellular telephone, his car, his home computer… It&rsquo;s hard not to wonder what exactly goes through mom and dad’s minds when they see them operate, huh? It must be reduced down to… Almost superstition, you know? Nothing Voodoo, mind you, but – in some way, deep in the mind of the average schmuck, his cellular telephone is quickly becoming his god.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake returned the phone to its holster and looked behind him to retreat enough to sit on his rough, pockmarked, and splintery cherrywood desk as Mr. Libel himself huffed through the door with a pronounced, angsty furrow in his brow, his right arm holding the sling of his ratty tote over the right shoulder of his even rattier creamy brown leather jacket. Even faced with the density of desks and flustered teens, he did not pause even though one would assume it was surely necessary.</p>\n<p>“Hello hello hello… Welcome, welcome,” said Mr. Drake more quickly, his head tracking Liam’s ungainly slotting upon a free, deskless chair against the farthest wall between twin spectacled boys with matching curly blonde afros, just behind Barney, followed by the careless thudding of his bag on the foot-worn carpet in front.</p>\n<p>“Right!” continued Mr. Drake from his perch. “And for you, it will become a god also, but one of a different sort… Many Godly persons desire their particular deity to do the work; to only interact with what’s on the surface, but you! You hold our newfound technological god as one to be known! And that is exactly how it should be… Not just for the sake of the knowledge, itself, but for the betterment of our lives… Now…”</p>\n<p>He placed both palms on his desk and leaned forward.</p>\n<p>“Before we again begin with our <em>history</em>, I want to tell you something very important… There’s a war on. And… You wanna know a secret?”</p>\n<p>Speaking in a more whispery projection, he leaned his bald patch forward a bit more.</p>\n<p>“There’s a war on… There’s a war on you!” He thrusted his pointer finger at the class – who maintained a collective stoicism – as he hopped again to his feet and began pacing, hands together behind him.</p>\n<p>“It’s on everyone who thinks… Everyone young who learns! It’s on everyone with progress on their minds… It’s a war waged even on knowledge, itself… A war of ignorance.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake paused, swiveling his gaze on his heels, gray eyes wide. In the rear, Liam scoffed loudly over the disinterested silence, slouched all the way back in his rigid chair and hoisting his legs to cross them on Barney’s left shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Ay, YO TEECH,” he yelled in Mr. Drake’s general direction, glancing left and right. “YO TEECH, you blaze tron?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake, frozen in the forward stoop he’d been glaring from, offered no reply. Barney brushed briskly at Liam’s Converses against his head as if they were a lost lunar moth.</p>\n<p>“Yo teech, you just tell me if you want a little somun somun, you know what I mean,” Liam said, <em>Ha Ha</em>ing with his right hand eclipsed over his smile.</p>\n<p>“Dude,” Barney complained. Libel sat up again and returned his feet to the floor, but didn’t otherwise acknowledge the protest. He threw his right arm into an arc over his head and made his hand into a vague pistol shape, pointed at Mr. Drake.</p>\n<p>“Ay, YO TEECH… BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVENA RON PAUL… Ha ha! YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY… THIS COUNTRY GOIN TO SHIT, <em>MAN</em>.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Drake self-consciously returned to standing upright, but his eyes looked miles beyond the far wall and his students – thirty-one of whom had yet to react at all.</p>\n<p>“Why is it ALWAYS BOXES, <em>man</em>? What’s with the FUCKIN BOXES? YO TEECH, THIS SOME BULLSHIT.”</p>\n<p>Barney set about gathering his things to escape the tirade, but Liam had begun to violently writhe about in his chair and appeared to be quickly descending into a fit, which exponentially slowed Blimp’s organization.</p>\n<p>“DON’T DO THIS, TEECH. DON’T LABEL ME!”</p>\n<p>His whole body was convulsing now and his magazines were bounding and bouncing toward serious altitudes on top of him like wheat chaff as it’s shaken free of the grain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AY YO TEECH… WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THESE CAGES ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And with that, his chair failed him as he shook to the ground on his hands and knees – still hollering in bodily tumult.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;COME ONNNN<em>NNNN</em> TEECH, YOU KNOW I CAN’T FIT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT BOX,” he spat at the rug.</p>\n<p>Neither Mr. Drake nor his pupils had moved or expressed anything, save for Barney Blimp, who stepped over Liam Libel with his backpack and threaded his way strenuously through the desks and static legs, feet, and empty faces through the door. A hundred yards down the hallway, as he leaned against the exit, a final croaking throw came from behind him.</p>\n<p>“<em>Ron Pal!</em>”</p>\n<p>The creaking of the exit door – hinges wanting for a greasing – and the <em>swooshing</em> of its bottom seal against the muddy black shoemat yielded not for Barney Blimp the fresh Colorado air and lucid sunshine, but instead – through a haze of drug-numbed internal retching and destruction – the stagnantly sterile, ammonia’d atmosphere and lifeless colors of a meager hospital room. From the open hallway to his left came an ambiently echoing broadcast of unexpected contextual quality.</p>\n<p>“Welcome, Frances Fujica Chamberlain, eleven pounds, six ounces,” said a theatrically raspy woman’s voice, followed by a pleasantly rhythmic rock sample.</p>\n<p>“*BLINDed by the light */ *revved up like a deuce */ <em>another roller in the night!</em>”</p>\n<p>Yet, it was the tiny wall-mounted television that captured Barney’s newly-awoken, moderately-medicated attention. From diagonally across his tall bed with its faded floral sheets and itchy medium blue comforter, the minuscule CRT blared a top-of-the-hour *Good Morning America *graphic.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, America. Breaking news, the FBI takes on Apple demanding the tech giant help with a terror investigation. Are critical clues to more plots hidden on the phone of the San Bernardino shooters? Why Apple&rsquo;s CEO is refusing to help this morning. A battle that could affect everyone with a smartphone,” said the voice of the aging anchor from under a dyed black combover to whom the introduction transitioned along with a lower third graphic that said “JAKE JINGLES, ABC NEWS.”</p>\n<p><em>Apparently, it is the morning</em>, thought Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“Good morning,” he whispered. Jake Jingles and his co-host Jaime Jangles then went on about the idiosyncrasies of the G.O.P., quoted and played back a clip of the current President saying <em>I believe so and so will never be President</em>, then a shorter clip of “BJ, a German Shorthaired Pointer” – clearly somewhere else in the studio, sitting obediently, cocking his head at the approaching camera lens – before finally returning to a wide-shot of Jingles and Jangles sitting abreast, smiling off screen at the dog.</p>\n<p>“All right, and good morning, America. There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club&rsquo;s Best in Show Award. He&rsquo;s just arriving here in Times Square. He took a walk there on our green carpet in case you missed it. We cannot wait to meet the top dog coming up. Hear what he has to say about his win. The biggest bone of all.”</p>\n<p>“A great-looking dog.”</p>\n<p>“He walks like a winner.”</p>\n<p>“He is.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely.”</p>\n<p>“Amazing,” said Barney Blimp, all at once noticing how uncomfortable his entire physical being had been left in its current, awfully-upright position against a mountain of pillows that looked promising, but disappointingly lacked fulfilling qualities one tends to hope for and enjoy in promising-looking pillows. He lifted his rear to scoot it down and felt an unsettling tremor of his out of kilter equilibrium atop faint whole-body pins and needles from – no doubt – remaining more or less stationary for hours?&hellip;days?</p>\n<p>“…have more on that later. But right now lots of reaction coming in overnight to that emotional appearance in the White House briefing room from Chief of Staff Eggs White. The former general raw and red-eyed as he defended the President, attacked his critics, and remembered the death of his own son on the battlefield. Chief White House correspondent Geoffrey Gouge starts us off. Good morning, Geoff…”</p>\n<p>Realizing the excess of the television’s current volume was insistently coercing the entirety of his attention, Barney looked about him – despite the dizziness – searching for the remote control. To his left, there was only empty space and the burst of brief, sickly draft from a cycle of the neighboring Intensive Care Unit airlock; to his right, a substantially loaded IV pole holding both black and translucent liquid bags, and a hang-over eating tray on castors which was – quite strangely – surfaced in a bright, neon-green neoprene, and contained a small-book-sized touch tablet. He reached for it, tapping the black screen with his right index finger’s plastic heart-rate monitor in an attempt to illicit life. After a few clumsy tries, he achieved a sort of success: an awkward, large-print menu faded into view with five haphazardly off-center options next to hopelessly-scaled stock graphics: <em>DRUGS</em>, <em>MEDIA</em>, <em>BILLING</em>, <em>SCHEDULING</em>, and <em>SUPPORT</em>. Barney tried <em>MEDIA</em>, but the subsequently displayed controls were muted somehow – left transparent. No amount of tapping yielded any change in the program, which had turned to a montage of B-roll: red-faced parents talking on mobile phones on the black asphalt – crowded to the point of insanity by neutral-colored SUVs outside a sprawling red brick building sprouting the tiniest trickle of gray smoke from the far wing.</p>\n<p>“The driver, look at this, pulled over after he smelled smoke, and that&rsquo;s when flames erupted. More than a dozen students from the Jacksonville area high school had to evacuate. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The children were picked up by a different bus and taken home. No word on what caused this in the first place, but certainly glad everyone is okay this morning, Jake.”</p>\n<p>“Thank goodness for that. And now to that big win overnight for the Los Angeles Dodgers, heading to their first World Series since 1988,” continued Jake Jingles as the slightest electronic pseudodance percussion was subtly faded behind his voice in the background – its 140 beat-per-minute high hats abnormally flattered by the bias of the pitiful speakers within the wall-mounted unit, furthering Blimp’s aggravation with the situation. He amplified his aggression toward the tablet, holding it just inches from his nose as he pounded his fingers on the glass. The original menu came briefly back into view before the <em>DRUGS</em> option was selected, swapping the theme entirely for microscopic, illegible text and alarmingly primary reds. The unassuming white plastic pump suspended in the middle of his IV pole suddenly clicked and began a drawling, whirred chugging. Panicking at the sound and the new movements of fluids he perceived, Barney vigorously attacked the big red <em>X</em> in the top-right corner with every ounce of available effort left in the stumps of his thumbs, and was – to his gracious relief – rewarded with the cessation of the horrors.</p>\n<p>“…guy behind looked so concerned until the last second. Also right now a lot of reaction coming to that emotional moment in the White House press briefing room. Chief of Staff General White, defending the President&rsquo;s calls to the families of fallen soldiers. Also took on the President&rsquo;s critics and opened up about the loss of his own son on the battlefield…”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp sighed in extreme exasperation and threw the tablet down on the tray, sinking under the sheets until his feet felt the footboard and hung over it, both hands desperately gripping the comforter, pulling it over his nose so that only his eyes-up were exposed. A new wave of drowsiness gushed from his numb belly and washed over him like sleepy molasses, tinging his vision light blue as he tilted it with his head on the flat bed below the pillow mountain to focus on a single one of the ceiling tile’s dark red polka-dots. <em>Spackled blood</em>, he thought – the removed Observer of his consciousness noting how much less anxious he was in the moment than he should’ve rationally been, while knowing, of course, that his state was entirely the result of whatever drugs they had him on.</p>\n<p>“Welcome, Leslie Désirée Lund, eight pounds four ounces… <em>BLINDed by the light</em>…”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp’s eyes drooped heavy as his Observer ceased short its attempt to recollect the sequence of events which led him there – wherever <em>there</em> was – it was a bed… a less-than-moderately comfortable bed… and instead considered the definition of “roller” in “<em>another roller in the night</em>.” Not <em>roller</em> as in “high <em>roller</em>,” no. Not “<em>roller</em> blades,” though it… he… <em>they</em> had always wanted to learn how to inline skate… <em>Aggressive</em> inlines. Speed skating was such an elegant, lost art. Why weren’t there more speed skaters swooping and sliding around, bent over with their hands behind their backs to cut through the air oh-so-beautifully… in all State and National parks… in cardigans… and purple sweatbands? <em>What happened to them all?</em></p>\n<p>“…and after the break, Jaime and I sit down with Theodore Pith, the young artificial intelligence pioneer and mogul, now author of a new book about cheese and the end of the world…”</p>\n<p>R-o-l-l-e-r, <em>roller</em>. A flour-dusted light wood cylinder with matching old style handles, loose… Loose, but that’s how they were supposed to be… how they had to be or else it would not roll separately of them… Except it was <em>huge</em>, and growing! Gargantuan! And the hands! Covered in dark black hairs of a simply *vulgar *length and nearly as big… Bringing the overwhelming girth of the surface – the *much *too <em>solid</em> and <em>threatening</em> surface – to flatten his body! Rhythmically rolling and squishing and flattening Barney Blimp and his organs against this awful, foreign bed like *fucking dough! *He was more conscious now, but still unable to move – completely paralyzed… And the hellish utensil was on its way back again! <em>Revved up like a deuce…</em> <em>The toes</em>, he remembered! He and his Observer concentrated everything they had on wiggling their toes… <em>really</em> wiggling… and finally… they wiggled alive!</p>\n<p>Liberated from his dream and waking paralysis, Barney shot up – sheets, comforter, tubes, cables, and all – inhaling massively only to see on the tiny wall television the pale, smiling face, flashing green eyes, and blood-red hair of his new boss sitting cross-legged in a purple chair astride the <em>GMA</em> watermark as the show returned from a commercial break. Opposite a table packed with granite-looking half-pipes full of steaming brown beans were the smooth faces of Jake Jingles and Jaime Jangles.</p>\n<p>“Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of the new, quite controversial but hot-selling book – especially here in New York, <em>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything</em>,” said Jake Jingles with occasion.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>, mouthed Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“…and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan barbecue joints, Pith&rsquo;s Chili Trough and Pith&rsquo;s Chili Playpen. We&rsquo;ve got what looks to be a&hellip; Ha ha, well&hellip; a miniature <em>trough</em> of chili right here in front of us. Wow! A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith&hellip; Your book seems well… It seems to be in direct opposition to what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?”</p>\n<p>“SON OF A *FUCKING BITCH!” *screamed Barney, hoarsely. His hands moved to fumble with the tablet again, mouth agape as Jake Jingles fumbled similarly in propping an obnoxiously-covered volume upright for the camera, on screen, struggling to obscure an apparently-obscene illustration of a nude woman covered in cheese – his right hand accomplishing the censorship of all but her cheese-strung feet behind the title text.</p>\n<p>“Yes, that&rsquo;s an understandable contrast to make, Jack,” Pith answered as the broadcast switched to his full-shot angle. He himself was deeply contrasted with the formal wear of everyone present – save for some of the studio audience, perhaps – with his pale, freckled arms sticking out of a plain white t-shirt which said on its front in a loud, large, simple sans-serif typeface <em>TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH.</em></p>\n<p>“First, I&rsquo;d like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared&hellip; Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don&rsquo;t be shy – get your hands dirty! It&rsquo;s Chili Day!”</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith waved wildly and dumbly, gyrating both palms at the present audience, off screen, who whooped and cheered in response. Their audience camera was clumsily cut to a bit later than it should’ve been. Jake Jingles forced a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“Well, there it is&hellip; You&rsquo;ve got to love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?”</p>\n<p>Jaime Jangles chimed in with an addendum, first two right fingers drumming on her chin.</p>\n<p>“And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?” She gestured toward his torso, emptily smiling.</p>\n<p>“First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there&hellip; I&rsquo;m actually going to start digging in, if you don&rsquo;t mind,” Theodore Pith said, shoving the provided logo-adorned bib under his right thigh.</p>\n<p>“No, of course&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll join right in with ya,” replied Jake, who sat forward and looked helplessly at the massive task before him.</p>\n<p>“I, myself, really don&rsquo;t find the book&rsquo;s argument in conflict with my love of- and affection for chili, particularly.” He threaded the provided (and also logo-adorned) garden trowel under a great yellow-brownish gop of beans and scooped it toward his maw, spilling a few ounces on the oversaturated rug. Jake Jingles was having one hell of a time shoving his own logo-adorned bib into the front of his shirt without rubbing his live lapel microphone unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>“That argument being – as I understand having read as much as I could last night – that our obsession with food is&hellip; Well, sort of rampant and infecting our culture-”</p>\n<p>“&hellip;and stealing attention from important efforts in humanitarian policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you <em>do</em> finish the book – and I really hope you do, George, really… – you’ll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it is by now our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome&rsquo;s time to fall, if you’re catching my drift.”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp was now a reddening, rigid live wire – his fury crossing a threshold in his heart monitor, setting off its alarm in triads. <em>Beepbeepbeep</em>.</p>\n<p>Jake Jingles – now equipped properly with logo-adorned bib – looked across the table in building agitation at Theodore Pith, twirling his clean trowel. From beside him, Jaime Jangles – yet to be misnamed, and thus slightly less huffy – offered her intermediation.</p>\n<p>“I have to say&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my Me Food – I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his <em>even more</em>, and it&rsquo;s hurtful, the suggestion that my interest in good food is somehow wrong or dangerous-”</p>\n<p>“&hellip;oh, James! Don&rsquo;t look so bashful! Please, do eat your chili!”</p>\n<p>There was a great, gaping, deadly live television pause filled with the swishing and swashing of the pale Pith’s rhythmic chewing over the 140 beat-per-minute electro beat, his otherwise quiet person in frame, t-shirt now covered in brown, eyes cast downward to the half-empty trough before him.</p>\n<p>Jaime Jangles cleared her throat.</p>\n<p>“I’m Jaime, actually…”</p>\n<p>The eyes came up with a full mouth, from which hung a six-inch-long string of cheese.</p>\n<p>“&hellip;oh shit, I&rsquo;m so sorry! That&rsquo;s really embarrassing&hellip;”</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith looked to her, then to the camera and back. Behind the camera, the audience conveyed together both amused applause and inverbal admonishment.</p>\n<p>“Jaime, please let me make it up to you… have some of <em>my</em> chili!”</p>\n<p>Jingles and Jangles cringed, smiled, and managed chuckles with all the restraint in the world.</p>\n<p>“Hey, now! There are families watching this live, Mr.- ”</p>\n<p>“…gosh, I am so sorry.”</p>\n<p>Theodore looked to the camera covered in chili as the shot cycled back to him.</p>\n<p>“Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-”</p>\n<p>“…let’s just try and get back to the book, alright?”</p>\n<p>“Sure, sure&hellip; It&rsquo;s really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.”</p>\n<p>The triplets of the Barney Blimp alarm had finally summoned a disheveled young orderly, who bussed immediately around the dismal bed to cease it in a blur of dark purple and Chanel No. 5.</p>\n<p>“Good, good! It’s good to see you up… Barney-“</p>\n<p>“Please turn off the television,” he said.</p>\n<p>“… I’m sorry?”</p>\n<p>“TURN <em>OFF</em>… the television. Turn off the TV, please.”</p>\n<p>The orderly looked up from the tablet on her forearm to the screen, where Jaime Jangles was hesitantly playing with her little shovel.</p>\n<p>“Wow, yes, I can&rsquo;t even visualize… How long did the process take, do you know?”</p>\n<p>“At least three&hellip; Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was,” to <em>wows</em> from Jangles, Jingles, and the audience.</p>\n<p>“For God’s sake, turn… it… <em>OFF!</em>”</p>\n<p>“That&rsquo;s actually&hellip; really no time at all,” said Jake.</p>\n<p>“Really quick,” nodded Jaime.</p>\n<p>“OFF!” screamed Barney Blimp, in a single, swift motion picking up the tablet and hurling it – inches from the nurse’s nose – to a perfectly placed impact on the little TV, cracking its screen and inducing a brief blip of white noise blinds, yet neither the horrid appliance nor his visitor flinched a bit. The later calmly returned her attention to her own tablet, then to the IV pole’s machinery.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Blimp, please try to control yourself.”</p>\n<p>Jake Jingles again stiffly manipulated the bright-orange volume, turning it in profile and then over, very deliberately assuring that the cheesy woman be excluded from the shot.</p>\n<p>“It&rsquo;s nearly five-hundred pages, right? And this is your first book?”</p>\n<p>“First <em>published</em> book under my own name, you know. I&rsquo;ve written a few other things, here and there, but that&rsquo;s a subject for another time.”</p>\n<p><em>Aw</em>, said the audience.</p>\n<p>“Sure, we’ve got to have you back some time,” said Jake Jingles with visible grit in his smile.</p>\n<p>“Jesus,” said Barney Blimp.</p>\n<p>“But, this apocalypse&hellip; Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or&hellip;?”</p>\n<p>“All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world…”</p>\n<p>“Mother<em>fucker.</em>”</p>\n<p>“…in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit&hellip; And yet, we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.”</p>\n<p>Up went the young woman’s eyebrows as she tapped her tablet, unpainted fingernails clacking.</p>\n<p>“Look, I’m sorry about the TV, but could you <em>please</em> just turn it off for me?”</p>\n<p>“A striking thought,” said Jake Jingles.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” she replied, making eye contact for the first time, eyebrows erect with no minimum of patronization. “I can’t do that, Barney, but I <em>can</em> have something to eat brought up for you, if you’d like.”</p>\n<p>“<em>…another roller in the night!</em>”</p>\n<p>“Quite. And that was the idea, but it&rsquo;s also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope – that Rome&rsquo;s decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I&rsquo;m glad you brought this chili with you&hellip; It <em>is</em> quite an achievement,” said Jaime Jangles, having eaten half a trowel’s worth.</p>\n<p>“How does that sound, huh…? It’s Chili Day!”</p>\n<p>Barney Blimp gripped the handles straddling his bed-bound prison so ferociously that he soon blacked out.</p>\n<p>⌬⌬⌬</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Gravel, it is with great haste and discretion that I write you regarding a patient who was received in the care of St. Nicholas’ ICU on Thursday afternoon (the 8th) – Barney Barry Blimp, age 30 – with a few requests in the interest of his particular and quite consequential needs on behalf of his very long-time friend and employer, Mr. Theodore Pith, who is deeply distraught and regrets that he is unable contact you personally at this time.

In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of <em>The Nice, Huge Estate</em>, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was <em>especially</em> reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all <em>his</em>, without a single worthy challenger.</p>\n<p>In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been <em>even more</em> otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at <em>Nice, Huge</em> – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.</p>\n<p>The latest favorite pastime of <em>Nice, Big</em>’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.</p>\n<p>“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“You’re not <em>busy</em>, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.</p>\n<p>“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Finally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.</p>\n<p>“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”</p>\n<p>Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say <em>guffaw.</em></p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”</p>\n<p>Lenny Lather had not… <em>could not</em> have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.</p>\n<p>“Jesus <em>Christ!</em>” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said <em>BLOOD</em> in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been <em>guffawing</em> plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-<em>guffawing</em> – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.</p>\n<p>As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.</p>\n<p>“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.</p>\n<p>“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.</p>\n<p>“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Right-o, as you say, sir!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Down to the <em>pu-hb</em> for a <em>spaht</em> of <em>brahn</em>-dee with me <em>mae-its</em>!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“<em>Oncemo-ar</em> right, pip pip!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“By <em>jah-lee</em>, there we are!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named <em>BLOOD</em> had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot <em>BLOOD</em> had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as <em>BLOOD</em> had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.</p>\n<p>“<em>Jesus Christ</em>,” had said the shortest.</p>\n<p>“<em>Holy fuck,</em>” had said the youngest.</p>\n<p>“<em>Gee whiz</em>,” had said the oldest.</p>\n<p>And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes <em>BLOOD</em>’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “<em>FUCK!</em>”</p>\n<p>The Sucking’s <em>FUCK</em> and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic <em>guffaws</em> with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.</p>\n<p>“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my <em>best</em> Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.</p>\n<p>“Tally-<em>ho</em>, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to <em>sneak</em> for a swift, full-chat <em>dart</em>, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his <em>People</em> Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, <em>excuse me</em>-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in <em>his</em> store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food &amp; Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been <em>in spite</em>. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his <em>excuse me</em> lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys &amp; Leather.</p>\n<p>“Sir! Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“<em>Excuse me!</em> Sir!”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”</p>\n<p>Keys &amp; Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”</p>\n<p>“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys &amp; Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation <em>and</em> arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.</p>\n<p>“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish <em>haha!</em> before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.</p>\n<p>“Man, <em>come on</em>,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.</p>\n<p>After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that <em>BLOOD</em> and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me <em>alone</em>?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.</p>\n<p>“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.</p>\n<p>“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As <em>BLOOD</em>’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-<em>BOOM!</em>”</p>\n<p>Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify <em>BLOOD</em> by <em>name</em> from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their <em>effectiveness</em>, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "## Chapter I\nGruel never yielded anything to a single soul, but most of the apartment's occasional guests – when they'd pay her any mind at all – mistook her resistance for- the indifference of morbid obesity, or the pervading detachment from life and reality resulting from prolonged suffering from the same. Barney had loved her in precisely the same cheesily-affectionate manner with which he did in their kittenhood, uninterrupted for nearly a decade, and thought he knew for certain how she felt about his touch – he assumed that when she fled in a sudden, fluid, ground-covering saunter to her corner's solitude, it was only an unfortunate, but inevitable involuntary reflex to his stocky presence, when in fact his volume failed one hundred percent of his hundreds of attempts to command any whatsoever. In the midst of female and/or unfamiliar company, he'd make a point to bend his bulbous puckering down to search for her eyes with his own, rubbing lightly together the pads of his thumb and index finger as he very deliberately extended the whole of the grubby device toward her snout, as if to point at her with the foul racket. For her ears, it was sautéed nails in a chamber pot; for her tastes, it was the sound of death.\n\nIn actuality, she had never once experienced even a wee grain of fear of the imbecile. As it happens, no living being – thinking and not – ever had or ever would, for the extent of his existence. If Gruel had been bestowed with the most boundless, ever-giving gift of complex linguistics, she wouldn't have batted an eye before loudly protesting her sentiments about his life, his noise, and his rank-ass hands as they approached her, sitting static in her green bowelled-out faux leather recliner, attempting to murder him with her eyes. Unfortunately, gray Tabbies are quite unlucky – or perhaps just out of all favor in the eyes of Chance, because they are the least equipped mammals by far when it comes to domestic dialog, though Gruel had learned to tolerate her companion's pervasively meek nature. She was allowed to languish about for the last few years of her life, eating just a bit more than she should every day, warming herself in the windowsills bathing among welcome patches of crisp mountain sun – on especially frisky occasions, even explicitly expressing her disgust by knocking one or two of Barney's collectible anime figurines off their wall shelf and onto the creaky, disused air hockey table in the corner. It's fairly widely-accepted in the scientific community that she, being feline, 1) could not possibly understand her own mortality in any substantial way, 2) could not maintain any sort of concept of the future, and 3) was extremely metacognitively limited, generally – without the ability to self-reflect. And yet, Gruel's day-to-day demeanor – were you able to translate the thoughts occupying the space between her two (especially soft) ears into an English internal dialogue – was full of easily recognizable human utterances.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" in response to Barney's more especially foul habits (like the horrendous rubbing.) \"Though I am actually going to die before you, you know. I see you there, poking your grotesque digits at me, cooing your fucking jowls, and it makes me sick,\" she'd continue. \"If we truly are creations of the omniscient judeochristian God, and he chose to keep you, he is no 'sadist,' but a nano-brained sky idiot intent on utterly wasting his limitless time.\"\n\nIf domesticated pet conventions were a bit different, and the course of evolutionary feline anatomy altered – if Gruel were able to verbalize and audibilize these sentiments to Barney Blimp from the first moment they came to be together, there's no telling which of them would still be alive, or if he'd have turned out a bit sharper. At thirty years old, Mr. Blimp was single, white, and frumpy. He'd moved them in to their downtown Denver apartment on his new boss's abrasive recommendation after landing a Senior Software Engineer position at MapQuest's then-new, 17,000 square foot headquarters just two blocks North; the company, itself a continually less-relevant navigation service and mobile application. For Barney, achieving a real tech industry job to which he could show up in pajamas and drink cheap beer had been a point of substantial pride, though the most he'd ever mustered would be considered minimal by any self-respecting individual. It was his privilege to watch over The Server Room, with its gray, winking racks, and arid, coppertone heat – where the data of millions of users was stored and exchanged securely. Granted, most of them were elderly – those few not quite old enough to stop driving (according to them, not their children,) but not fresh enough to detach themselves entirely from physically printed digital directions. The gap was narrowing by the week, but Barney didn't mind much – it kept his job consistently low-stress, sparing him daily energy he'd need in the after-five dash home to log in and take over for his Mountain Time afternoon shift, watching over the virtual skies through a simulated radar scope on the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation network (VATSIM).\n\nFrom around the world, commercial pilots-in-training would log in using complex home built addons to form a cohesive virtual world – the dullest Massively Multiplayer Online Game ever spawned – in which they'd simulate every monotonous detail involved in captaining a passenger flight – the flight plan, the kneeboard checklist, and – if the locale was chosen correctly, where a supervisor was present – the communication with air traffic control, including clearance requests, readbacks, handoffs, and approvals – every one of the most irritating bureaucracies involved in contemporary flight. Even the longest-aging simulator titles could be Frankensteined to subject a user with realtime-updated weather, delays, traffic redirection, etc, necessitating a student to use all of the real-world weather monitoring services as they'd be required – as well as the judgments which would depend on the data – throughout the rest of their long, hateful, empty careers. After they'd earned their certifications to fly real aircraft, the vast majority would be glad to leave VATSIM behind forever. (Not even jet pilots want to digitally recreate the tedium of their day job during off hours.) However, a select few ultra-dorky aviation nerds like Blimp participated for no reason at all except for an especially quaint masochism spending thousands of their living hours engaged in absurdly-realistic simulations of one of two notoriously high-stress jobs – Captain or air traffic controller – without any expectation of compensation. It is in these extremist communities that you'll find the most rule-following, law-abiding, legislation-jerking twerps in existence today. General Aviation Dads are the grunts – the muscle of petty, aggravating adherence to their everpresent FARAIM manuals – a glossy, ten-pound, yearly-updated collection of every single regulation enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration – but most have legitimate careers, wives, and moderately healthy children. Hardcore Simmers, however, are an inexplicably dedicated bunch – bile of the least-socialized sort – not for the sake of competition, fun, nor even mastery. When asked, Blimp spoke of his dedication as if it was an (unsolicited,) diehard duty-bound slavery – he was needed by the community. In the context of their continued function, it was true – he was Ultimate Air Boss of the Denver Area Digital ARTCC – but his sudden, permanent, unannounced absence would debatably result in little more than a minor inconvenience; a few broken, too-Germanic hearts.\n\nRegardless of the reality of his role, Barney Blimp needed to be needed, as one says. Over the course of his half-decade participation in the organization, he had somehow amassed over 20,000 online forum posts, communicating with the membership – which maintained a populace of fifty or so – and logged some 4,500 hours as a virtual air traffic controller. He'd flown a little high-winged Cessna as an adolescent for an hour with an instructor – his mother's gift for his fifteenth birthday – and had savored every one of the handful of opportunities his working life allowed him to fly commercially, an elderly laptop balanced on his knees and a massive headset strapped to his skull, streaming and scrutinizing every monotonous exchange between the relevant parties of his flight. Friends and co-workers tended to catch on to the Blimpisms quickly – and knew they necessitated consideration as charming sensibilities – or they would be unsuccessful in forming or maintaining any sort of relationship with the man – he zealously held his obsessions in indefatigable First Priority, which was undeniably the only respectable thing about him, for Barney Blimp was in adulthood a zealot of indifference, above all.\n\nThe computer fan whined into another of its labored peaks and the bottommost of the four blue lights in the tower's inner lip began to pulse quickly for a few moments before its blinking returned with the wind to their intermittent normality – an endless, untiring oscillation that Gruel had more or less concluded to be the thing's unholy breath. A voice – preadolescent, muffled, and rurally earnest pushed its way through a three-figure headset and three days' worth of dandruff from above.\n\n\"Tacoma ground, Southwest six one seven... mic check.\"\n\n\"Southwest six one seven, Tacoma ground hears you,\" Barney breathed. The sudden nostril whistle from his inhale had started her from her waking dream in the everlasting twilight of hypnosis that defined his room. Never day or night – the displays over which his eyes were perpetually rolling were always the primary, unsatisfactory source of light. This abominable furniture ruled the cat's life by proxy, as her companion was totally bewitched by its relentless, all-hour religion.\n\nHe shifted forward, clicking and dragging more rapidly, his feet clawing dumbly at the rubber to creep him as he cleared his throat. His eyes did two laps of the bottom left screen before he settled them on its bezel and raised their brows, expecting a request.\n\nJust he began to inhale again, it came through, hesitant and crackling. \"Tacoma ground, hello. Southwest... six one seven requests IFR clearance to Phoenix.\"\n\nAt once, Blimp straightened his back and faced his left screen as he queued the keyboard, inhaling deep to begin \"Southwest six... one seven, you are cleared to Phoenix viaaa... Correction, as filed. Maintain 5000. Expect flight level three five zero ten minutes after departure. Departure frequency one two zero point four. Squawk 7500.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair for the retort, taking his can of energy drink with him.\n\n\"Cleared to Phoenix as filed. We'll stay at 5000, expecting three five zero in ten, over to departure on one two zero point four. We're squawking seven five zero zero for Southwest six one seven.\"\n\n\"Southwest six one seven, readback correct. Expect runway one six left via...\"\n\nAnd it went on. All of Gruel sat spread over her paws, wearing into the same spot of the musky white carpet – a few inches behind the office chair's serrated, coffee-stained rubber mat, her ancient girth holding the white globules, bent. A crater would be her legacy – the final record of her thousands... millions of hours spent watching hairy white feet idly shift in ambient electric gloom, while her deranged, dysfunctional guardian looked at the wall, mumbling numbers to himself in spurts.\n\n## Chapter III\nAs the trio exited the Baker St. headquarters, five brawny mercenaries in gargantuan cargo shorts silently climbed out of a Volvo SUV 1,200 miles West under a red-swathed, beautifully late-sunrise sky o’er the parking lot of a suburban Oakland Trader Joe’s. Instinctively, four promptly fanned out behind the fifth point in a pseudotactical formation as they crossed the rutted asphalt to the sliding automatic door, and instinctively, they formed up once more to enter it, ruthlessly retracting a shopping cart each in perhaps the most efficient manner five human beings have ever done so. With their comically small vehicles (none of the men was shorter than six foot one; none less than 230 lbs.,) they fanned out again – still wordless – in an even distribution across the aisles to the existential astonishment of the three, groggy-eyed cashiers on the opening floor.\n\nWere you to snag the security camera footage – perhaps even just that of the wide-angled unit at the far end of the store – you’d be responsible for a swiftly-Bacterial Internet Video, no doubt. The men each produced a PDA as they infected the empty rows of goods at almost exactly the same, clinical pace – looking to double check a list they unanimously knew by memory, anyway. #1 grabbed 3 gallons of organic, grass-fed whole milk, 2 gallons of high-pulp, fresh-squeezed orange juice, 3 cartons of organic, free-range eggs, 74 ounces of organic, certified-humane goat cheese, 1 16-oz. container of organic _cottage_ cheese, and an entire, 7.5 lb. wheel of organic parmigiano reggiano. #2 went for premium, organic canned goods. #3 ordered two each of nine cuts of the best stead available from the bewildered butcher… _and so on_.\n\nLess than ten minutes after they’d arrived, the entire crew descended upon the checkout lanes with nearly a quarter-ton of combined merchandise, but the staff had prepared – a panic over the radio had even drawn out the _General Manager_ to occupy a lane, and the lot – usually annoyingly friendly (they were paid very well to be so) – were almost completely silent, reflecting the curt intensity of their massive, intimidating customers throughout the ordeal. It turned out to be mostly unnecessary – the last hulk out turned his crew-cut head and forty-pound neck to smile and wave.\n\n“Have a good one,” he said.\n\nThe fivesome pushed their carts to the car, the plastic bags crackling a cacophony. The tailgate was lifted and the rear stuffed full – the last man piled the remainder in the laps of the other three passengers as they sat, chuckling at the vehicle’s visible, squat burden as he aggregated the empty carts and jogged them back to the stack. The driver followed shortly after to pick him up and the whole, fully-loaded operation proceeded to the freeway, chariot slogging under the load.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nLenny snorted a healthy bump from the tip of his knife in the back of the Mulsanne as Pith diced the blow with a Kroger Discount card atop an original Guttenberg Bible in the next seat.\n\n“Jesus wept,” he said.\n\nThe job was less than arduous – it was the good stuff.\n\n“This has the potential to become your first _good joke_,” noted Tharp from the driver’s seat.\n\n“Have – had you ever done this before?” asked Lather, sniffing and swallowing with his drip, at once impressed and surprised that he’d retained his ability to speak in correct tenses.\n\n“Technically, yeah, but it’s been a helluva while.” Pith arranged himself two gluttonous parallel lines before retrieving a bespoke sterling silver straw from his breast pocket.\n\n“It used to be small-town newspapers – two years ago, if memory serves.”\n\n“A _bad_ joke,” said Lily.\n\n“_Not _a joke, by the way – some would call it philanthropy.”\n\n“Uh huh... Wack.”\n\n“I think they’re all a lot better off now, and don’t tell anyone, but my faith in local journalism is one hundred percent sincere, hand on heart.” He pointed the straw at the first line and proceeded to lap it up, thumb on opposite nostril. Reeling, he then carefully passed the Lord’s Word & silver hoover to Lenny, stifling the fiend’s temptation to once again attack his steno pad.\n\n“Uh.” Tharp turned in want for alarm to watch two police interceptors in full, angry blues ’n’ twos speed by the hastily-arrested traffic in the oncoming lane to slide and haltingly screech in front of 1555 Baker St., from whence the three had just come. “That’s overreacting.”\n\n“Great for the scrapbook though!” Pith smiled and looked at the camera bag by Lenny’s feet, then to his eyes, then to the bag, and back again, but it was no use – he was fucking slammed, eyes lost in Theo’s salmon and yellow reflection in his window, and their light was green. The scene of the crime was soon out of sight.\n\n“You know, federal prison would be _fascinating_,” he added, slapping his thigh.\n\nLily scoffed.\n\n“You’d be fucked.”\n\n“You could come with, I’m sure! It’d be a riot! You could infiltrate the guards… Or, hey! You could apply for a wardenship. That’s real you.”\n\n“You don’t want to know how much that’d cost you.”\n\n“_Actually_…”\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nThe Volvo exited the swiftly-congesting freeway and its haggard multitude of late-week commuters for Nob Hill, the San Franciscan angles seriously testing its overloaded suspension and the precarious arrangement of its occupancy. The driver took 6th St. South, descending through cafes and theaters to video stores and payday loan offices before parking adjacent Market St. \n\nHazards on, he fished his mobile phone from the center console and made a call.\n\n“We’re standing by,” he said, but a tremendous turbodiesel whistle interrupted him from the other end.\n\n…\n\n“We’re waiting.”\n\n…\n\n“I _said_… WE ARE HERE.”\n\n…\n\n“… HERE.”\n\nA pause. _More_ whistling and the trailing end of a garbled scream.\n\n“..AAT?!”\n\nExasperated, the driver removed the phone from his ear and began melodramatically pounding out a text message with his ginormous thumbs – backspacing, mostly – clicking and popping over the steady ticking of the hazards. From behind the huge artisanal cheese wheel, a passenger loudly cleared his throat. After a few extraordinarily difficult minutes, the brute in the front seat finally decided to turn with his lap-bound bundle of full egg cartons and share the crude joke he’d been sitting on with the three abreast behind him, but was interrupted by the sight of a rogue city garbage truck turning through the intersection of the prior block. He tapped the driver’s shoulder and gestured generally rear before slumping back (as much as was possible for a man of his size) in the seat, frowning.\n\nStaying the ticking, he pulled out, garbage truck now in tow, and began the descent to the Tenderloin District and its bleak spectacle of waking homeless. Up and down the lines of them they went, stubby necks craning – tracing a search pattern in the dilapidated, pothole-ridden grid. After fifteen minutes, the driver’s eyes began to flirt more and more worryingly with the alarming display of the fuel gauge, but then he spied his prey, finally, across from where they waited at a red light for nobody – six men in ragged coats; two sitting on the ledge of a concrete retaining wall bordering a pitiful garden containing nothing but a handful of weeds at its epicenter, one prone in a sleeping bag at their feet, and the rest forming a semicircle around a black steel trashcan with a wide, well-ashed rim.\n\n“_Alrighty then_,” he sighed, running the red. The garbage truck didn’t hesitate to follow and the convoy parked directly and evenly in front of the bin. In an almost ballet-like unified coordination, the occupants of both vehicles egressed – the four Big Men holding the handles of the bulging grocery bags they’d cradled in their laps, the fifth headed rearward for his own handful; the two high visibility jacket-swaddled waste disposal crew, one carried a roll of standard black trash liners, the other stuffed both hands in his pockets – to the undivided attention of their audience, including the occupant of the sleeping bag, who’d rolled over at the noise as if to say _do you mind_, but remained silent. The two groups formed lines, facing one another – seven on six. The two men on the ledge descended to their feet without thinking, expecting _some _kind of trouble from this lot.\n\n“Hey!” one shouted, but there was no response save for the rustling of the plastic bags held still. They stood that way, searching each other’s eyes for a full minute – an eternity, but not a one of the street’s original, rightful six had formed any theories. Finally, the driver stepped forward and with his left hand swung a bag full of smaller, limper bags full of fresh vegetables so that it rested on the lip of the trashcan. He fixed his eyes on those of the sleeping bag man – by now sitting up with his gloved palms flat on the ground behind him, wearing an explicitly puzzled set of eyebrows – and began deliberately pulling the produce out with his right hand, one by one, only to throw them straight into the can’s opening with building aggression. A beet, two carrots between two fingers, a series of onions… All surrendered immediately to the black, fetid abyss. He went on like this – eyes unwavering – until his bag was empty and he turned, wadding it up to toss it in the gutter, where it began immediately to open again and travel away in the breeze.\n\nThe next two stepped up with their load and began upon the same. Bananas, individually peeled off the bundle, then Granny Smiths – faster and faster – Red - then Golden Delicious, lemons, oranges, half a dozen grape vines, handfuls of kiwi, a whole bag of cauliflower heads. Theirs filled it to the brim and they stepped aside for the second trash man to remove the lid, coax the drawstring of the bag off the inner container’s lip, and hoist the whole up and out of the basket to the ground, where he quickly tied the top into a knot and set off with it for the truck as the first tore a new liner from his roll to replace it. He held the bag with both hands, whipping its expansion with the wind, then shoving his right hand into it and down the basket, wrapping the end around the outside, replacing the heavy lid, stepping away for the next two.\n\n“Hey… what the fuck man?”\n\nThe sleeping bag man’s voice – unused for the better part of a day – was mostly lost to the wind, but it would have been futile, regardless. With purpose, the process was repeated – three trashcans full of the freshest high-dollar groceries, coldly… hatefully deposited – until the lot was depleted and both mercenaries and disposal men returned wordlessly to their respective vehicles and sped off in opposite directions, leaving nothing but horrid offense and a small storm of crinkled plastic bags bearing the words _THANK YOU _in dark, Trader Joe’s green.\n\n## Chapter II\nAll-nighters had not-so-gradually become a habit. Perhaps if you’d even rudimentarily charted his sleep over time, he’d have startled (assuming he wouldn’t be able to distract himself away,) but he’d continued to successfully grow his vices exponentially, under his own conscious threshold. It’s not as if he were *actually* unaware of what it meant for a human body to constantly consume so much caffeine and sugar in order to force it through so many nights, but his inhibitions had shrunk within him as his ability to conceptualize his own future had faded – by now, into virtually nothing.\n\nHe was arriving, this morning – as to the increasingly-frequent others – without having slept a wink through a particularly lively Wednesday night as the primary Boss of all airspace in and around the greater (digital) Seattle-Tacoma maze. The more sustained traffic there was – *operations*, as they’re called – the greater the test was of Barney’s ability to shepherd – or, *vector* – and delegate incoming & outgoing flights. He’d truly entered a brainstate of primal gluttony for occupation of his mental bandwidth – the vast majority of his life decisions across the board could be explained by servitude to his especially tedious preference in stimuli. After the indulgence of the night-long deluge, he’d hand off his post as the sun came up to reflect in relative stillness amidst his rapidly-hushing beta waves.\n\nThis morning – as on the increasingly-frequent others – he planned to dither about for precisely long enough to make him seven minutes late to work, which involved the mindless, protracted consumption of two bowls of bland instant oatmeal over the course of ninety minutes while a progressive loop of the television program *M\\*A\\*S\\*H\\** played, mirrored on both his computer screens at near-whisper volume.(fn) Whatever was left of his attention was dedicated in its entirety to his smartphone’s display as he methodically sifted his favorite internet message boards for the most current available Joke Images of a popular, but universally-crude, de-intellectual type. When he happened upon an especially effective example in private, he would involuntarily produce a brisk, mild whooshing nearly identical to that of a muted sneeze – when among casual friends or twice-found acquaintances, the discovery would cause him to steadily, nasally chuckle for an empty tenth of a second or so longer than was generally appropriate.\n\nContinuing to self-administer the necessary beverage to sustain his function simultaneously with so much otherwise-unaccompanied oatmeal meant he would almost always need the restroom, where he would sit – still scrolling – until precisely nine minutes before his intended time of arrival to the downtown office on Blake Street. He’d swing out of the bathroom and tend to the inevitable mess his breakfast would leave in the common area with barely enough effort to warrant a thin excuse later to his slightly more fastidious roommate, Craig.(fn) This time, he not only left his dirty, oatmealed bowl in the sink, unrinsed – he failed to place the gallon of milk back in the refrigerator or even replace its cap. For a moment, he winced at the new boundaries he was pushing, but the clock on the stove already read 8:30, and it was ten minutes and forty-one seconds ahead.(fn) He haphazardly dumped a cup of kibble into Gruel’s pan – which she would wait over half an hour to acknowledge for the sake of her pride in front of her constant illusion of an attentive audience – and set out the sticky, offset door unshowered and unshaven in the same dour sweatshirt and lustless, stonewashed jeans he’d been wearing for over two days.\n\nDown the steps, around the only corner convenience store in Colorado that carried Hell-brand energy drinks, and by the hideous Pepsi Center stadium went Blimp, pumping his stocky limbs, inducing his singular facsimile of the phenomenon known as *Runner’s High*, which was enhanced by the caffeine in his system and his tired, anxious brain’s above-average indulgence in adrenaline. This tendency of the body to react to sleep deprivation by entering an amplified, exponentially gradiented state of charged excitement (or, panic, for some) out of self-preservation was an especially significant one of a few responsible culprits in the reward system that sustained Barney’s new lifestyle. Challenging his body this way manifested an artificial sense of adventure which even the grandest possible pleasures at his imagination’s disposal could not.\n\nIt undoubtedly didn’t help that his employers were not in a position to punish his mediocrity *or* reward any excellence, as their service’s usership had been in decline for almost a decade. MapQuest, originators of the convenient format of digital navigation, had been unable to maintain their relevance – operating at a loss since before anyone left in the office could remember when. As per the unfortunate, long-pervasive status quo, Blimp’s late arrival – at 8:34 – was not observed by anyone but himself. Through reception without a glance, then the badly-aging, bizarrely-lit, haphazardly-colored habitat of his groggy, destitute coworkers, past the small central “huddle rooms,” each marked by a graphic of a smartphone search bar containing a fantastic destination – *Taj Mahal, Pyramids of Giza, Colossus of Rhodes,* and on – Barney Blimp sought his half-desk in the open mid-rear of the space.\n\nHe plopped and slumped in his chair, but stared at the worn neon geometric shape in the carpet by his feet for a brief moment of dissociation before logging in to stare in exactly the same fashion at his work inbox. When asked about his indulgence in sleep deprivation by the few friends who knew him well enough to be concerned, he would cite his responsibility to the virtual air traffic community as a mentor and sentinel, but the reality was that *he enjoyed it* – most of the results of asking one’s mind to extend its healthy uptime constructed a high for him that no other practice or substance, alone, could. The stress would maintain a state of hyperawareness while in front of his screens, and would help remove him in a critical way from the tedious and mundane of his daily life. Some part of him was reading emails, yes, but it was less conscious than it would’ve been – than it was for his loopy, reductive, hideously-daft deskmate, Edgar, who was technically Blimp’s subordinate, but had long since realized Barney Blimp’s total lack of interest or finesse in delegation. There was little in the way of other faculties in him, save for an impressive, practiced ability to carry a single-sided conversation for hours.\n\n“So apparently my Grandma managed to fuck up my parents’ new DVR with *Judge Judy* recordings in less than a week – I think they bought it the day before Easter or something.” Neither man moved from their skimming. \n\nEdgar huffed.\n\n“I know I should care about the acquisition thing but uh… as long as the coffee is still good, ya know? Fuckin Thursdays,” he said, huffing again. “I think we’re gonna try to get a new TV soon so I can have the one in the living room. Hopefully 4K.” (fn)\n\nBarney looked beyond his display to the fake petrified wood siding on the far wall, idly trying to remember the last film he’d seen for any reason other than the excuse to gluttonize liberally-buttered popcorn. *Something Millionaire*, he thought. With Craig and his super-hippie girlfriend, maybe two weeks after he’d first moved in. He’d sipped down four and a half bottles of her homemade pilsner and they had all three more or less simultaneously turned ill. Probably food poisoning – that\\* rock-in-the-stomach\\* sensation, but nobody had actually thrown up, if his memory served him. They’d just gone to bed somewhat early and neglected to do anything together since, which didn’t bother Barney as far as he could tell – he preferred to socialize through the coy and entirely-controllable context of clearances and vectors.\n\n*Fuckin Thursdays*. What a foul, meaningless expression to be breaking the beats of his dissociation! *What a foul life*, his head said.(fn) His gaze returned to the unread messages in his inbox, tricking him in a momentary spell of dizziness. The *Thanks*, before his supervisor’s boss’s signature in her memo from the previous week with the subject line “Further thoughts/heads up on the future” briefly became *Thursdays*, in his periphery. *Fuckin*, he thought. His neck began to cramp, so he shifted his legs, took another putrid gulp of Hell, and again fingered the scroll wheel. “FW: Friday’s HUGE BLOWOUT PARKING LOT SALE” from his landlord – who’s stimulant prescription, petty, shapeless home life and resulting general aggravation with procrastination led him to carry on the notion that Blimp might one day fix his derelict hatchback, if prodded enough – became “FW: Fuckin HUGE BLOWS.” \n\nHe smirked in insolvent agony.\n\n“…like I could do some A/V on the side or something instead of going out every other night.” Edgar’s granular drivel had finally managed to cross the threshold of Barney’s awareness. “I guess I don’t really need the extra cash, but I looked at my savings to pitch in for the TV and it *sucks*.”\n\nBarney Blimp gave him all of an exhaling, cocked head side glance with a vanilla smile. “Same here,” he said.\n\n*Fuuuuckin Thurs-days!* It was musical now – too quickly mutating in time with the melody of *Rule Britannia.*(fn)\n\n*My sav-ings real-ly sucks. Bri-tons ne-e-e-e-Ever will be slaves! *And it continued… Without REM sleep, his mind’s ability to parse relevant information was in steady decline, which made for him his Hell’s Hell; his surrealist heaven. *Fuckin Thursdays.* Enough of his consciousness was left to wonder why so much of mindless contemporary office dialogue orbited around the topic of which day of the week it was, how that came to be – or, if it had always been an inescapable fact of human existence.(fn) *Fuckin Mondays*, in so many words.\n\nIn the office chat window behind his inbox, the occupants of the whole were doing their *Thursday morning *best to professionalize their panic in their responses to an announcement that had been pinged company-wide just a few minutes before.\n\n“\\*\\*\\*Correction: he’ll be visiting today at some point.\\*\\*\\*”\n\nEven if Barney had been sufficiently present in this fuddled reality to take notice, his inattention was already elderly enough that it wouldn’t have mattered. Telecom companies had been curiously (but not altogether passionately) circling MapQuest for its liquidatbles like lazy, non-committal buzzards for so long that it scarcely crossed the minds of any but the remaining three executives – and even they had considered their tenure too unappetizing to warrant much worry. It was assumed that their parent company, AOL, would be bought soon in a huge, several billion dollar merger, and that they would be brought along – if not for any other justification than sparing the bidder the inevitable inconveniences of a split.\n\nEdgar was again submerged in Blimp’s ether – now on the topic of “vintage” stereo receivers: how analog units could still be adapted for digital cable boxes, and why they should be – as he set about writing his first reply of the day cross-department to the head support tech about an issue with duplicate integrated customer reviews from other services that they had both agreed to overlook nine times already in Q1 alone. This time, though, a single Yelp! review of a Des Moines brasserie had reportedly been pushed in over 450 duplicates, blanketing the page with broken text for who-knew-how-many users, which was posited to potentially cause a cascading series of bugs across several servers at any moment. Continuing to argue that the issue was not yet worth any resources from the position of a Senior Programmer would have been a truly audacious display of negligence, but Barney was feeling especially lazy, so he began.\n\nAs the refusal was pounded into being, a slight commotion stirred in the direction of reception and a young, supremely professional-looking woman dressed from heels to hairpins in bright silver strolled dangerously quickly through the far doorway toward the corner office carrying a black leather document case. Chief Technical Officer Peter Built – its sole occupant – was the first to notice her and look up from his screen, chin still on his palm when he made contact with her eyes. For a second too long, he felt a primal burst of absolute terror, but he managed to push away from his desk, button his blazer, and stick on a smile which she half-returned as they met at the doorway.\n\n“Mr. Built,” she said, reaching for his hand.\n\n“Ms. Tharp.”\n\nFrom where she’d been moments before, two disheveled young men followed like straggling ducklings, turning around in wonderment with gleeful smiles, taking in their surroundings as if they were just entering a petting zoo for the first time in their newly post-infantile lives. The first was a noticeably superior mess – tripping over his ruthlessly-worn brogues, rapaciously swinging a fringed camera bag with distant, bloodshot eyes. The other looked nearly as maniacal, but his suit was obviously tailored, if composed by a colorblind madman – apparently for none less than a clown. It was primarily salmon wrapped in a banana taffy jacket, and it couldn’t possibly have clashed any more vigorously with the pumpkin orange, neon green, and royal purple palette of the whole godforsaken office.\n\nHe led the other now, practically rubbing his hands together as he strode between the common area’s ping pong table and the bleary-eyed pair – Barney Blimp and neighboring Edgar, who was still obliviously babbling – studying them as if he might just stop to bend down for a closer look. Tharp and Built had paused their business to look on as if watching their respective pets sniff each other at the park, free of the leash. The messy one took a place in the corner at the intersection of the two thigh-to-ceiling panes of glass window and their gray, mid-morning sky as the adorned man leapt atop an unoccupied desk, knocking over an ergonomic keyboard. He began speaking without prompt or context.\n\n“You wanted to know Theo Pith’s identity. I am the man who has asked that question.”\n\nOnly a few yards away, Peter leaned back on the metal frame of his office door, grabbing it for support. Edgar finally shut his mouth and swiveled to look at the commotion, aghast.\n\n“*I am the one who has asked that question!*” shouted Pith, stifling a giggle. He jumped to the floor, satisfied with the handful of gazes he now held, and began pacing.\n\n“Too many of the individuals I encounter have an irrational, often very intense bias or mistrust of any institution that is *selling* them something. To them, the customer is always the priority in business interactions, and I've been wondering... why? *Is* the customer ‘always right?’ Should I really assume - as a business owner who's made my life into a particular product or trade, who's probably read about regularly for years, likely been forced (if not sought) to examine the quality of my efforts directly and indirectly against vectors of peers of the same profession, and habitually ponders such things several times every day - that an individual who more likely than not has *no other vested entrance* in my industry should be treated as the higher authority? That any old bloke who walks in to my operation – literally or metaphorically – is superior to myself, even in that space. The idiocy is easily evident, but the mentality is more destructive than you'd think.”\n\nBuilt – still watching, wide-eyed – moved timidly to a worn “chair” (nothing more than an orange semi-solid fabric cylinder) and sat deliberately down, leaning forward to clasp his hands together in front of his knees. Ms. Tharp remained where she was, watching Theo in noticeable boredom atop a morsel of amusement. In the corner, the most distressed of the entourage shifted his weight to the other foot, producing a steno pad & pen from his jacket’s inner pocket and attentively jotting two sentences upon it. The event had finally captured Blimp’s attention and turned his glassy eyes, but his hands still hovered in stasis over his keyboard. Increasing the velocity of his pacing further still, Pith continued, green eyes strafing the scene.\n\n“All of us know somebody who knows how to use their customer privilege to their advantage, consciously or unconsciously. To be fair, I think it's unconscious – not malicious – for the majority. These folks will call a customer service number and scream *dissatisfactions *and threats at all the poor souls in the hierarchy until they get a refund, a lower price, or some other special privilege. And for that, they're often rewarded – they are an insignificant enough fraction of the base that the industry can afford to give in to them, and so it perpetuates... But what if you had the opportunity to skirt the risks and buck the bitches back? What if you had the opportunity to be proud of your product and not give a damn how it's received? What if you were given a ticket to the ride on that bubble – that security that only the impossibility of failure can enable? What if I told you I wanted to make that happen for MapQuest? What sort of transformations would this office undergo?”\n\nA man and woman turned briskly ‘round the far corner of the conference block on their way back from the opposite break room, simultaneously ceasing their chat and their speed upon the spectacle. From the outside street, the dampened sirens and buzzed honking from a passing ambulance could be heard through the soundproofing. The audience of the raving now totaled ten souls, most bewildered.\n\n“I realize that I crash my own wedding – that it's basically both arranged *and* whirlwindish, but research on relationships shows that both sorts are much more successful than you might suppose!”\n\nHe paused to show a smile to the whole room. It was left unrequited.\n\n“Perhaps we should proceed as if these are the only two types – perhaps *that* would give us a chance at imagining something truly different. I have always loved your platform, personally – I have myself carried many directions along successfully to many unfamiliar places, and who knows how much I should thank you all for how much resulting calm!”\n\nHe paused again to look off – as if daydreaming – to some distance of his imagination beyond the ceiling’s dotted tiles. “Ah, the effect of nearly anything printed! A more serene spirit than a screen will ever provide, I think… and that is why I’ve bought you.”\n\nHe left a silence – still without expectation of a response – before beginning yet again.\n\n“The last time I slept, I had this dream. There was this couple – a man and woman – living in a sort of Roman/Venetian hybrid future where the Catholic Church had bought Google and begun to use its platforms to sell Indulgences again to billions of users. Like... AdSense, but significantly more aggressive, and soliciting financial reparations for sin. I first met the guy... looked *exactly* like Paul Walker, told me he raised cattle. I was a consultant or something... working on redesigning an obscenely efficient HVAC system for the Church, for no other reason than... well, they suddenly had *even more* cash, and actually couldn't figure out how to blow it fast enough. One day, I get a call about an explosion on the project and I find out that Paul Walker, his girlfriend, and their friendly pet panther, Sophie are the prime, on-the-ground triad of an anti-Googlechurch terrorist organization. This whole digipapal monstrosity was just explicitly conspiratorial and hilariously evil with so much sudden, consolidated power and wealth that it actually crippled them – they couldn't organize quickly enough.\n\n“So, I've been thinking – independently of my subconscious, of course... well, as independently of one's subconscious as one can possibly think – I’d like this acquisition to be an opportunity to reimagine ‘longform’ directions, if you will. You guys have spent the past few years building a very competitive and unique mobile navigation experience, and I think you’ve done an astonishing job with the resources you’ve had – you’ve definitely made Google *feel *like idiots among themselves, but it’s time we make them *look like fools* to the rest of the world for treating the sacred task of guidance with so little respect. Detailed, precise directions are MapQuest’s wheelhouse, and the ways you’ve figured out to express that philosophy in a mobile app are truly astonishing, but now that you have essentially nothing to lose, I want to take this company back to its roots… its home grass.\n\n“I know... I'm sure you have a bunch of agenda and performance presentations to whip up for me, but I can't be reassuring enough, here... it's really, just fine. Irrespective of what's coming in and going out, I'm going to commit, here and now, to keeping MapQuest in the black. It's completely fine. Whatever happens – just don't dump budgets directly into Ugandan email scams or anything... try not to topple senselessly, I guess – but whatever happens, you'll all have your jobs for the foreseeable future, but with a lot more freedom to do what you feel like doing. For now, your two directives are simply *nobody leaves or gets fired for any reason*, and *from this day forward, the app will be treated as legacy software*.”\n\nThe pacing stayed just in front of the center-desked pair, and Pith locked eyes with the now almost sullen Blimp, clasping his hands behind his back as he curtly bobbed his chin and inhaled for a conclusive followup.\n\n“This is my supreme Head of Operations, Ms. Lily Tharp,” he said, gesturing toward her stoic post. “And my friend from the *Wretched Economist*, Mr. Lenny Lather.” From the corner, Lenny looked up from his pad scribbling just long enough to nod in reply.\n\n“My name is Theodore Pith, and I have bought this company. It is my sincere hope that none of you go home today with negative feelings toward myself or your future here because I can’t emphasize enough how secure it really is. I’ll be in touch, and we’ll be back in Denver within the month for more professional discussions on where this needs to go. Though I intend to get to know each and every one of you, I’m afraid my time is tight, today. That said… does anybody have any questions for the moment?”\n\nNobody and nothing. Barney Blimp had long since left his body behind in the words and Edgar was cartoonishly dumbfounded. The walking pair had sat on the furthest unoccupied desks within line-of-sight. Peter Built conscientiously closed his mouth – which had been open for who-knows-how-long, and Lily stared at the floor. Lather had caught up with his steno pad(fn) and leaned against the window that was the wall, sensing within himself the swimming tadpole of insufficiency – he would need more cocaine soon.\n\nPith looked at his wristwatch. “Ah, well… it’s early! *Too *early for this kind of talk, I’m sure. We’re gonna jet, but we’ll certainly be returning within the week to meet each of you one-on-one. The Q’n’A can wait till then, of course. Enjoy the rest of your Thursday!”\n\nThis time, he was in the lead out of the office, his smile gone. Tharp wordlessly slipped a bright matte orange business card to Peter as she passed; he looked into her eyes like a begging leper as he grasped it in his fingers like a secret. Lenny lurched off the wall and stuffed his things in his bag, shuffling to catch up. The following silence was profound – finally broken by Blimp from his distant gaze.\n\n“Fuckin Thursdays,” he said.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAs the trio exited the Baker St. headquarters, five brawny mercenaries in gargantuan cargo shorts silently climbed out of a Volvo SUV 1,200 miles West under a red-swathed, beautifully late-sunrise sky o’er the parking lot of a suburban Oakland Trader Joe’s. Instinctively, four promptly fanned out behind the fifth point in a pseudotactical formation as they crossed the rutted asphalt to the sliding automatic door, and instinctively, they formed up once more to enter it, ruthlessly retracting a shopping cart each in perhaps the most efficient manner five human beings have ever done so. With their comically small vehicles (none of the men was shorter than six foot one; none less than 230 lbs.,) they fanned out again – still wordless – in an even distribution across the aisles to the existential astonishment of the three, groggy-eyed cashiers on the opening floor.\n\nWere you to snag the security camera footage – perhaps even just that of the wide-angled unit at the far end of the store – you’d be responsible for a swiftly-Bacterial Internet Video, no doubt. The men each produced a PDA as they infected the empty rows of goods at almost exactly the same, clinical pace – looking to double check a list they unanimously knew by memory, anyway. #1 grabbed 3 gallons of organic, grass-fed whole milk, 2 gallons of high-pulp, fresh-squeezed orange juice, 3 cartons of organic, free-range eggs, 74 ounces of organic, certified-humane goat cheese, 1 16-oz. container of organic *cottage* cheese, and an entire, 7.5 lb. wheel of organic parmigiano reggiano. #2 went for premium, organic canned goods. #3 ordered two each of nine cuts of the best stead available from the bewildered butcher… *and so on*.\n\nLess than ten minutes after they’d arrived, the entire crew descended upon the checkout lanes with nearly a quarter-ton of combined merchandise, but the staff had prepared – a panic over the radio had even drawn out the *General Manager* to occupy a lane, and the lot – usually annoyingly friendly (they were paid very well to be so) – were almost completely silent, reflecting the curt intensity of their massive, intimidating customers throughout the ordeal. It turned out to be mostly unnecessary – the last hulk out turned his crew-cut head and forty-pound neck to smile and wave.\n\n“Have a good one,” he said.\n\nThe fivesome pushed their carts to the car, the plastic bags crackling a cacophony. The tailgate was lifted and the rear stuffed full – the last man piled the remainder in the laps of the other three passengers as they sat, chuckling at the vehicle’s visible, squat burden as he aggregated the empty carts and jogged them back to the stack. The driver followed shortly after to pick him up and the whole, fully-loaded operation proceeded to the freeway, chariot slogging under the load.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nLenny snorted a healthy bump from the tip of his knife in the back of the Mulsanne as Pith diced the blow with a Kroger Discount card atop an original Guttenberg Bible(fn) in the next seat.\n\n“Jesus wept,” he said.\n\nThe job was less than arduous – it was the good stuff.\n\n“This has the potential to become your first *good joke*,” noted Tharp from the driver’s seat.\n\n“Have – had you ever done this before?” asked Lather, sniffing and swallowing with his drip, at once impressed and surprised that he’d retained his ability to speak in correct tenses.\n\n“Technically, yeah, but it’s been a helluva while.” Pith arranged himself two gluttonous parallel lines before retrieving a bespoke sterling silver straw from his breast pocket.\n\n“It used to be small-town newspapers – two years ago, if memory serves.”(fn)\n\n“A *bad* joke,” said Lily.\n\n“*Not *a joke, by the way – some would call it philanthropy.”\n\n“Uh huh... Wack.”\n\n“I think they’re all a lot better off now, and don’t tell anyone, but my faith in local journalism is one hundred percent sincere, hand on heart.” He pointed the straw at the first line and proceeded to lap it up, thumb on opposite nostril. Reeling, he then carefully passed the Lord’s Word & silver hoover to Lenny, stifling the fiend’s temptation to once again attack his steno pad.\n\n“Uh.” Tharp turned in want for alarm to watch two police interceptors in full, angry blues ’n’ twos speed by the hastily-arrested traffic in the oncoming lane to slide and haltingly screech in front of 1555 Baker St., from whence the three had just come. “That’s overreacting.”\n\n“Great for the scrapbook though!” Pith smiled and looked at the camera bag by Lenny’s feet, then to his eyes, then to the bag, and back again, but it was no use – he was fucking slammed, eyes lost in Theo’s salmon and yellow reflection in his window, and their light was green. The scene of the crime was soon out of sight.\n\n“You know, federal prison would be *fascinating*,” he added, slapping his thigh.\n\nLily scoffed.\n\n“You’d be fucked.”\n\n“You could come with, I’m sure! It’d be a riot! You could infiltrate the guards… Or, hey! You could apply for a wardenship. That’s real you.”\n\n“You don’t want to know how much that’d cost you.”\n\n“*Actually*…”\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nThe Volvo exited the swiftly-congesting freeway and its haggard multitude of late-week commuters for Nob Hill, the San Franciscan angles seriously testing its overloaded suspension and the precarious arrangement of its occupancy. The driver took 6th St. South, descending through cafes and theaters to video stores and payday loan offices before parking adjacent Market St. Hazards on, he fished his mobile phone from the center console and made a call.\n\n“We’re standing by,” he said, but a tremendous turbodiesel whistle interrupted him from the other end.\n\n…\n\n“We’re waiting.”\n\n…\n\n“I *said*… WE ARE HERE.”\n\n…\n\n“… HERE.”\n\nA pause. *More* whistling and the trailing end of a garbled scream.\n\n“..AAT?!”\n\nExasperated, the driver removed the phone from his ear and began melodramatically pounding out a text message with his ginormous thumbs – backspacing, mostly – clicking and popping over the steady ticking of the hazards. From behind the huge artisanal cheese wheel, a passenger loudly cleared his throat. After a few extraordinarily difficult minutes, the brute in the front seat finally decided to turn with his lap-bound bundle of full egg cartons and share the crude joke he’d been sitting on with the three abreast behind him, but was interrupted by the sight of a rogue city garbage truck turning through the intersection of the prior block. He tapped the driver’s shoulder and gestured generally rear before slumping back (as much as was possible for a man of his size) in the seat, frowning.\n\nStaying the ticking, he pulled out, garbage truck now in tow, and began the descent to the Tenderloin District and its bleak spectacle of waking homeless. Up and down the lines of them they went, stubby necks craning – tracing a search pattern in the dilapidated, pothole-ridden grid. After fifteen minutes, the driver’s eyes began to flirt more and more worryingly with the alarming display of the fuel gauge, but then he spied his prey, finally, across from where they waited at a red light for nobody – six men in ragged coats; two sitting on the ledge of a concrete retaining wall bordering a pitiful garden containing nothing but a handful of weeds at its epicenter, one prone in a sleeping bag at their feet, and the rest forming a semicircle around a black steel trashcan with a wide, well-ashed rim.\n\n“*Alrighty then*,” he sighed, running the red. The garbage truck didn’t hesitate to follow and the convoy parked directly and evenly in front of the bin. In an almost ballet-like unified coordination, the occupants of both vehicles egressed – the four Big Men holding the handles of the bulging grocery bags they’d cradled in their laps, the fifth headed rearward for his own handful; the two high visibility jacket-swaddled waste disposal crew, one carried a roll of standard black trash liners, the other stuffed both hands in his pockets – to the undivided attention of their audience, including the occupant of the sleeping bag, who’d rolled over at the noise as if to say *do you mind*, but remained silent. The two groups formed lines, facing one another – seven on six. The two men on the ledge descended to their feet without thinking, expecting *some *kind of trouble from this lot.\n\n“Hey!” one shouted, but there was no response save for the rustling of the plastic bags held still. They stood that way, searching each other’s eyes for a full minute – an eternity, but not a one of the street’s original, rightful six had formed any theories. Finally, the driver stepped forward and with his left hand swung a bag full of smaller, limper bags full of fresh vegetables so that it rested on the lip of the trashcan. He fixed his eyes on those of the sleeping bag man – by now sitting up with his gloved palms flat on the ground behind him, wearing an explicitly puzzled set of eyebrows – and began deliberately pulling the produce out with his right hand, one by one, only to throw them straight into the can’s opening with building aggression. A beet, two carrots between two fingers, a series of onions… All surrendered immediately to the black, fetid abyss. He went on like this – eyes unwavering – until his bag was empty and he turned, wadding it up to toss it in the gutter, where it began immediately to open again and travel away in the breeze.\n\nThe next two stepped up with their load and began upon the same. Bananas, individually peeled off the bundle, then Granny Smiths – faster and faster – Red - then Golden Delicious, lemons, oranges, half a dozen grape vines, handfuls of kiwi, a whole bag of cauliflower heads. Theirs filled it to the brim and they stepped aside for the second trash man to remove the lid, coax the drawstring of the bag off the inner container’s lip, and hoist the whole up and out of the basket to the ground, where he quickly tied the top into a knot and set off with it for the truck as the first tore a new liner from his roll to replace it. He held the bag with both hands, whipping its expansion with the wind, then shoving his right hand into it and down the basket, wrapping the end around the outside, replacing the heavy lid, stepping away for the next two.\n\n“Hey… what the fuck man?” The sleeping bag man’s voice – unused for the better part of a day – was mostly lost to the wind, but it would have been futile, regardless. With purpose, the process was repeated – three trashcans full of the freshest high-dollar groceries, coldly… hatefully deposited – until the lot was depleted and both mercenaries and disposal men returned wordlessly to their respective vehicles and sped off in opposite directions, leaving nothing but horrid offense and a small storm of crinkled plastic bags bearing the words *THANK YOU *in dark, Trader Joe’s green.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe ruckus they had left took a few minutes to build, but those clouds in the glass were beginning to make way for the Spring sun and the implications of what had just occurred filled the office with it, albeit less warmly. They reflected coldly between the spheres of colored furniture and Peter Built noticed for the first time how much iridescence they’d lost since his and his company’s Last Chance, six years ago. In a single 2012 push, they’d completely redesigned themselves – both their space and their service, pushing further into mobile for salvation, despite the fact that every one of their competitors would completely outclass them, there, from the get-go – as yet fruitlessly – and he still abhorred with his whole being the tryhard quirk of both opposing languages, just as he had then. They’d hired a San Francisco firm that specialized in offbeat interior architecture, and the whole project had taken just five months, but it was now hard to believe that it had not been obvious how poorly the space would age, and yet – anything more tasteful than the inelegance of the out-of-style-for-several-years factor would have been dishonest.\n\nHe started the float back to his own vulgar partition and desk – now beginning to bake in the high sun – where his phone was indicating all signs of being paged. Now was not the time. He hovered over the receiver and was stricken with a fantasy: surely, he could make it out the door to the adjacent parking lot with a minimal chance of interception – and even if he was intercepted, he could simply *push the interceptee into oblivion* – to his car, which he could drive in *triple digits* to I-25 – he’d never been pulled over for speeding, so surely some form of roadway Karma would serve him – then North for only *what, fifteen? sixteen hours?* and he’d be freed by the mythical lakes of North Dakota… or Minnesota, perhaps, where he could drop off the grid and fish from a the simple serenity of an eleven foot john boat with his own homemade tackle for *how many years? *before his savings ran out. Correction: *their* savings – his wife, Ingrid’s and his. *She could come too!* She would agree to it, with enough pleading, he thought. But by that time, the “heat” would surely be “on” them.(fn) *No*, he refuted, defeating himself as he picked up the warm receiver and put it to his ear.\n\n…\n\n“Peter?”\n\n…\n\n“Mr. Built… the police are here,” said Madge, at the front desk, spooling up his excitement once again.\n\n“What?...”\n\n“The police are here. I called the police.”\n\n…\n\n“Those people threatened me! I called 9-1-1!”\n\n… and he was defeated again, fantasizing now about ripping open the top-right drawer of his desk to grab a boxy Glock handgun (that was *not* actually contained within,) and blowing his brains onto the detestable colors of the inner wall so that Madge (and presumably, the police she had summoned) would hear the blunt blast through both her headset and the open office.\n\n…\n\n“Mr. Built?”\n\n…\n\n“I’ll be right up.”\n\nHe threw down the phone and miserably flummoxed his attempt to half-leap over the desk, funneling the intensity of his resulting shame into a furious beeline march past Barney and Edgar, who had resumed discussing the timetable of his new television purchase in *even further* detail, oblivious to the volcanic upswell of his deskmate’s internal peril. Blimp was writhing visibly in the Genesis of hyperventilation, cold sweating through goosebumps, rocking to and fro in his $2000 chair. A part of him, removed, was now fully aware of – and supremely alarmed by – the hot, raging toil that was rapidly occupying the controlling faculties of his system to a soundtrack of distorted, infinitely multiplicative instances of that same, spirited performance of *Rule Britannia*.\n\nAfter remaining unnoticed in the same position for the better part of an hour, he suddenly shot violently to his feet, flinging the chair against Edgar’s to stand rigidly with his hands at his sides. The whole present MapQuest population had by now stuffed the space full – most feeling mostly helpless, looking down at their hands, leaning against tables, walls, or chairbacks while the rest traded in hushed hypothesis. Barney surveyed them, moving only his head, slowly – a crazed turret atop his inelastic form.\n\n*A̶r͜o̷-ò-̴o-͜o̴-ose͠ ͡from òut ̡tḩe ͢a-͝a-a-̀z̢ure m͘a̛i̴n*.͏\n\nHis breathing still quickening, he clenched his fists in the overwhelming noise.\n\n*L͡o͞u̡d҉ bla̶s̷t ̴a̛bo̡v͏e ҉u̷s̛,͜ ͡ĺoud ҉b̢laşt th̵at ̢t̕e͢a͟r͘s͝ the͞ ͠ski̴es*.\n\n“…arndog! Barney!”\n\nIn his ignorance, Edgar thought of his behavior as nothing more than a subject to tease – yelling for Blimp, *The Corporate Playmate* as he returned the chair, back-first with both unwashed hands.\n\n*Mo̡re dre͜-e-̢e͜-͏e-̸e̛adf͟ùl̕ ͟f͞r͘om ̕ea͝ch ̨fore͏iģń str҉o̴k͜e̷!*\n\n“Hey BARN-dog, what’s the *deal*?”\n\nBarney whirled around in a lightening fashion, stealing the chair from his hands and hoisting it – in no mild frenzy – above his head, howling.\n\n*S͏t͟il͘l m̀ore m̶ąje-̵e-̵e̵s͜tić s̡ha͜lt͘ t̢hou͝ ̡risȩ,*\n\nEdgar’s smirk was still in the process of disappearing as Barney brought – with the fullest potential intertia – the whole mass of the thing down upon his nose, castor-first.\n\n*M̧or͠e ̵dread͡f͏u͘l, d̢ŕea̴dful͜ f̷ro̷m҉ ͝e͘a̛c͡h ҉f̸o̸reiǵn ̵ştr̕ok͢e,*\n\n“*FUCK*,” he squealed from under the disjointed heap, toppling to the floor. Barney let go of the lot and set about kicking it with extremely vigorous fury. Edgar’s cry had definitively captured the attention of the crowd; the previously positing of the bunch turned instead to gasping. Both computer displays were lifted high, torn from their cables, and pounded into him with the same veracity and degenerative shrieking.\n\n*S̸e̛r͏ves but ̸to ͟r̴o-̶o-̷o-o̷t̸ ͢t͜hý ͠nati̴ve ͢óa̴k!*\n\nNot lost enough in that oh-so-intolerable carpeting, Barney’s screaming intermittently dipped into feral, unnatural cackling as he turned away from Edgar’s squirms and began devouring all of their shared workspace’s contents that could possibly be manipulated into his furious maw. First, all three thumbdrives – one from his own tower; two from the corner dust behind the rings of dried cola where the bases of the displays had been. Still swallowing repeatedly to ingest the lump of the last, he started on his own aluminum computer tower, punching its plastic front over and over again until its compact disc tray opened obediently to reveal an ancient bootleg driver installation CD sporting a stick-on label in Comic Sans,(fn) which he violently plucked up and folded, cracking it into 3, then 12, then 36 pieces before proceeding to devour the dusty, glassy mess in handfuls. Complacent with his consumption, he moved on to the next row of used workstations, kicking over anything that stood, gurgling through the blood that now flowed from his mouth.\n\nAt reception, Peter Built was absently addressing two rotundly uniformed, absently present officers – the taller of whom looked to be no more than ten years old (so absolutely that it was by far the most alarming issue present in all four minds, including his.) The young Madge Teeth made it plain that concern for her own safety had prompted her call, above all else, and was yet the only party who had paid any mind to the menacing noises coming from the deeper office.\n\n“You need to understand, this visit was just routine.”\n\n“Routine?”\n\n“Yeah, routine.”\n\n…\n\n“It wasn’t scheduled – I had no-”\n\n“That was my own failing – I assumed an office-wide Slack message would be enough. Obviously, I assumed incorrectly.”\n\nDespite the placement of his right hand on his chest and a forward tilt of his receded hairline, Peter’s self-criticism didn’t seem to take, so he continued.\n\n“Truthfully, it’s all my fault. This is all just a misunderstanding – I should’ve taken steps to keep everyone better informed – especially Ms. Teeth, of course – but no crime has been committed here.”\n\nMadge stood behind her five hundred dollar swiveling bar stool, hands clasped together on her skirt front where they awkwardly remained as she craned her neck around the wall divide to ogle Barney Blimp – now profusely bleeding from his mouth and hands, coughing up shingles of plastic and glass – setting his delirium upon the “City Park” common area and its center stack of business literature.(fn) Her eyes widened as he rolled up a two week old issue of *Fortune* in order to semi-successfully scarf it down like a chili dog. Elsewhere, two exposed cables from a power supply had shorted, igniting a section of drywall and the surrounding outmoded carpet. Squeals penetrated the swift spawn of black smoke as the sprinkler system abruptly drenched the entire populace. Madge languidly returned her attention – still wide-eyed, now soaking – to the preposterous scene in reception.\n\nNeither officer had moved nor spoken – their four, dull eyes had remained, unblinking, on Chief Technical Officer Peter Built as he continued to rephrase his apologetic explanation in a futile haste for some action from his audience at increasing volume over the rapid beeping of the fire alarm, lips dripping and spitting.\n\n“We were acquired last week rather suddenly, you see, and our new owner is a bit eccentric.”\n\n…\n\n“I wasn’t told he was going to visit this morning until thirty minutes after my arrival.”\n\n…\n\nPeter – no veteran of law enforcement interaction from his societal and social position – thought he would try altering his language a bit to sound as close as possible to that of their inter-cop dialogue to bridge whatever obstacle there was between them. He considered the terms he knew from crime television: *suspect*, *pursuit*, *informant*… But none fit, and his recollection was expeditiously exhausted.\n\n“Communication with his people has been sparse, hectic, and frankly *rude*, you know,” he said, chuckling emptily through the downpour. The buildup of water in his eyelashes was becoming critical but he could still see the officers well enough to perceive their apparent lack of all perception, to his exasperation. Over the discord of the alarm and the shower from the depths of the office came another especially aggressive war cry followed sequentially by a distressed chorus of both male and female shrieks.\n\n“My sincere apologies for wasting your time, gentlemen. Naturally, the company can take care of any fines you’d normally collect for this sort of thing.” He gave in to the urge to rub empty his stinging eyes as a group from sales filed between Peter and the officers holding laptops and binders over their faces, bound for the door. Madge gathered her bag and her shoes and followed the herd to the stairwell.\n\n“No, you know what?” Peter fished out his wallet from his jacket and thumbed out a few pasty, sogging fifties.\n\n“I can just take care of it myself, right now. How about that?”\n\nHe stepped forward – cash and hand outstretched and dribbling in alms to the two, whose eyes followed it vaguely in thirst – their first significant expression. The three stood unmoving in that way for a moment as more fleeing employees shuffled around them, eyeing the exchange in progress without any remaining care or registration.\n\n“Look, it doesn’t matter. Just take it!”\n\n…\n\n“Just take it and *go! Please!*”\n\n…\n\nHesitantly, the preteen-looking one obliged, pinching the wad between stubby forefinger and thumb before waddling in tow of the refugees, partner just behind, waddling in tow of him. Two programmers dragged a battered, bleating Edgar by his armpits over the floor in front of Peter Built, who watched on with an insubstantial frown, wet wallet still in hand. Distractedly, he turned against the steady current of evacuating employees to his office, where he sat in front of his ruinous desktop(fn) and began constructing another revised off-grid fishing fantasy, still oblivious to the torrent and the pungency of the burned plastic smell which had circulated throughout.\n\nAlso unaffected by the same – but nevertheless losing momentum – Barney Blimp’s rampage had grown in creativity despite having lost its entire spectatorship. He’d managed to entangle a giant, sparking chain of printers, monitors, towers, and peripherals which he dragged with great effort across the feces he had uniformly deposited over both conference tables in the presentation room. If there was any Final Vision which his new, out-of-control self was trying to achieve with all of its trouble, it was not evident to any of the conscious parts of him, nor to any of the three Great Big Firemen who arrived to the odorous corporate apocalypse just as the sprinkler system’s reserve had been finally depleted.\n\n*There are still two left in the building*, the crowd downstairs had said. But immediately, there was only the one – the drenched Chief Technical Officer Peter Built, who found the intervention of his fantasies by the Great Big Man sent to retrieve him rather obtuse, but he complied with his request to be accompanied out of the building, smothering his irritation in a most British way(fn) – a prefaced apology for the behavior he was *about* to exhibit.\n\n“Sorry if I come across rather annoyed – I was just distracted you know,” he explained as he was led firmly by the elbow down the steps.\n\n“I really do appreciate the service.”\n\nThe remaining Great Big pair in black t-shirts with identically-cracking Denver Fire Department crests(fn) and identically-patterned sweat stains spread out carefully – as their discipline dictated – to search the ghostly ruin of MapQuest’s remaining (and yet defiantly ghastly) crown jewel for the hopeful survivor of… this act of *domestic terrorism*. Each Great Big independently noted the particularly off-putting color palette of the space but – neither quite secure in their own respective aesthetic authority – no such criticism was verbally expressed. Neither, however, shared the same failing confidence regarding their comprehension of mobile software design.\n\n“Hey, MapQuest!” noted Great Big 1.\n\n“Hey, yeah, I think I got this app,” replied Great Big 2, stepping over the disturbing spectacle of a flickering display lying against the spider web-shattered safety glass of a smaller collaborative “Huddle Room,” valiantly attempting to reproduce the color-inverted playback of a lewd elementary stick figure animation.\n\n“Man, I haven’t thought about MapQuest in forever. There’s an app?”\n\n“Yeah, it’s great – I still use it when we help move Barb’s clients. Lot better than Google Maps, man,” said Great Big 2, and – were the office itself a perceptive, thinking organism, it would’ve suffered in that moment, observing the perfection of this *organic*, *freewheeled, unleashed*, *reconceptualized* marketing opportunity that was flinging, *unharnessed* into the ether – but it was not sentient (fortunately in just about any other conceivable context,) so the organic ad copy genius of the Great Bigs would go forever unappreciated, though their courageous and *seriously juiced* demeanor would serve each well in their chosen, infamously-underpaid profession, even (or especially) then, as they discovered the trailing end of a great incomprehensible train of decimated computer equipment weaving around the door jamb of the dark Server Room. Great Big 2 fished his Great Big flashlight from his Great Big belt, but its Great Big batteries appeared to be exhausted completely – shaking it repeatedly didn’t seem to do the trick – so he produced his Great Big smartphone and – after a Great Big wait of more screen tapping with his Great Big fingers than could’ve *possibly* been necessary – the Light-Emitting Diode came to and revealed at the end of the mass in its gaze the nude, blood-soaked husk of the unconscious MapQuest Senior Programmer, Barney Blimp.\n\n“Jesus,” said the Great Bigs.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIn the definitively matriarchal, mostly Germanic travel hub of Limon, Colorado, Barney, Barry, and Betty-Anne Blimp had begun the 1990s in a position to thrive. Barry, a Vietnam veteran with a chipped canine, an inherited family hog farm, and “crazy eyes” was headed down a new life avenue at forty-two in partial convenience store ownership with his best high school bud Tommy and a few of Tommy’s less-than-virtuous associates, which was – in such a prospective intersection of byways: the Kyle Railroad, Interstate 70, and proximity to the State’s two dominant metropolises – the *bee’s knees*. Marriage to his third wife, Betty-Anne had cemented his newfound potential satisfactorily enough to be granted a business loan from the lone regional banking chain the same week their first and only child was birthed, snipped, and dunked in Lutheran from-concentrate Holy Water.\n\nBarney’s mother was an embodiment of this Brisk American Process – never doing anything without haste; denouncing even in middleage the necessity (or existence) of *The Long Game*. Despite her pace, she had found in Librarianism a place of belonging on her first go – graduating from the University of Denver with a Masters in Library Science at just 19 after testing in before she could legally drive thanks to the diligence (and yes, the speed) of her homeschooling. If the Limon Memorial Library could even remotely afford a memorial statue, a towering Betty-Anne would surely grace its grounds now, brass-in-motion with her youthful black curls as near as feasibly perpendicular in a trail behind her form, as the institution owed its entire existence to her ruthless wit and otherworldly, naturally-amphetamined energy.(fn) If one took it upon themselves to speculate, they might suggest that it was indeed her speed that grayed, then bleached her curls white within a single year; that the circumstances surrounding Barney’s creation were from most planes of analysis quite tardy, and that Barry – while perhaps the most appropriately quick match she could’ve made – was a bad decision; that mothering a child after one’s hair has entirely silvered was uncouth and unnatural – much less after it had wholly *whitened*. One is free to indulge these speculations, but Betty-Anne never traveled in an even remotely slow enough velocity to hear or ponder or engage with them, right up to her Judgment Day before her Maker, in fact, whom she no doubt found aggravatingly dull.\n\nIt’s largely forgotten by those who’ve traversed the class divide in the 21st century that childhood in Barney’s era had changed little since that of his parents’ in diet: afternoon cartoons, ketchup, macaroni, hotdogs, and the lot – albeit a bit more processed. There were still Marvel superheroes, arcades, billion-piece, tediously-assembled model cars & aeros, and Little League. The difference – according to the retrospective ponderings of the architectural Boomers themselves – was in the way Merit & Achievement were processed. They say it was the cushion of encouragement and their own elimination of Loss – as factor, variable, and fact of the reality which they crafted for their kin – that fucked up entirely their children’s potential ability to climb above it. In Barney Blimp’s case, however, the fucking was certainly of more nuanced origin, as “losing” was defined differently, with an even greater weight in his mind than his parents’ generation could have possibly imagined.\n\nBarney never lost in track, baseball, football, or basketball because he never lowered himself to compete in such worldly things. He found most of his 200-odd graduating classmates lacking in luster, but in the blossoming neo-puritanical world of online gaming, Blimp had the pick of the globe, and from preadolescence onward he spent his time virtually among all manner of millennial punks learning how to challenge himself – in fact, learning *above all* to be competitive. The ideal gamer in the early days was a brotherly roughhouser who competed even in cooperation, regardless of their success, and the glorified *Shithead* persona sat well with the jaded group of five highschool friends who adopted and eventually socialized him.\n\nEast by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of the Rockies, the meat of Colorado is – as its nearest Easterly neighbor is so notoriously – *fucking flat*. In daylight, one's field of vision – one’s entire world – is constricted by the limitations of Earth's curvature, which dooms their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of Barney’s home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions. Over years and decades of existing in such a small place throughout such a formative time, human beings like Blimp and his peers live with a profoundly specific spatial psyche, boundaried absolutely. In a town like Limon, it can be tempting – for a visitor – to sift through the longtime occupants according to how they choose (or – depending on one’s choice position within the nature/nurture argument(fn) – are *predisposed*) to respond to these boundaries. It is not unreasonable to say – timidly, anyway – that *most* find comfort within them, and – much less timidly – to say that they lead overwhelmingly more satisfied lives. Others – like Barney’s *Limon Six* – end up classically claustrophobic and tend to spend significant time and energy in their formation of abrasive relationships with both physical and psychological bounds. An integral compounding effect on this aspirational affliction could perhaps be attributed to their Boomer parents and their intermittent, vague insistences like *you can be anything you want*, *you can do anything you set your mind to*, and their infinite variations.(fn)\n\nThe Blimps traveled phenomenally often for a Limon family but never incurred the notion – as long as travel was within their wants and means – to leave North America. Nevertheless, young Barney’s primary preferences for any given road trip were simply for the exploration of altitude; by distant or traversed mountains – by far the most bewitching – and commercial flight, when it was afforded. Whether by backseat or Boeing, the perception of distance enabled by proximity to more diverse typography was nothing less than a treat and his own continent’s allotment seemed plenty. It was these higher experiences that provided him a penetrating catalyst of the sort of ethereal meditation comprehendible only by those who’ve yet to develop past a certain age; the sort which many seek in a plethora of desperations until they’re able to accept its loss. The edged flirtation of Earth with sky were the elemental constants he’d be forever doomed to seek. For the lucky Most, however, the altitudes are not so relentlessly haunting and the six-mile planet is rarely insufficient, but the curiouser of them are universally bound with the whole by their want for understanding that Other aspirational itch as the occupants of each pole are with one another, inevitably, regardless of how fervently they happen to reflect upon the decider.\n\nThe inevitable binding was also for the others of the *Six* – Leona, Leo, Liam, Lazarus, and Lexie – out of their collectively loosening grip on the special Magic in each, as many or most friendships are, and together they observed in themselves and one another the development of their internal compulsion to find a suitable replacement, and – when at their best – maintained an audit of its power. Most of the instances of need did not come when it felt feasible to fill them with literal wandering as they do not for all but those few with unlimited resources. Farming or service-funded families raise children who must smoke weed and/or drink cheap beer in bulk as their world darkens and squishes, and so *The Limon Six* of Limon Junior-Senior High School entered their stoner stage shortly after their original congregation, when Barney was fifteen and so wholeheartedly, insularly elitist that his preferred external self-projection was of generalized insanity – though of the least manageably interesting variety – in order to discourage any and all contact with as broad a portion of his peers as possible.\n\nThe fallibility of young Barney Blimp’s plan was his own innate desire for companionship, which 1) prevented the scheme from ever being *truly* wholehearted and 2) necessitated input from other perspectives, as the execution of any human intention will, thereby contradictorily arranging himself to fail. Lazarus, the Junior – the eldest of the lot – was predisposed to target Barney’s person at lunch hour as a thoroughly weird, but nevertheless compulsively social young man.(fn) It was only September when he one Wednesday sat down across from Blimp and immediately began discussing amateur radio operation and its untapped potential among American secret societies, unprompted.\n\n“So if the Masons are *not *a secret society,” he began, “why is it that they specifically developed secret methods of identifying one another in public and – really – what even *defines *a ‘secret society’ if not its investment in the development of secret methodologies for its participants’ intra-identification, anyway?”\n\nBarney stopped chewing with a mouthful of his daily one-dollar ham sandwich and bored his eyes into Lazarus’ resting thumbs. In response, they began vigorously twiddling straightaway.\n\n“Of course, they made sure to place their symbology everywhere, which I would imagine is probably pretty fun. I wonder if they just screen *National Treasure *on repeat for regular meetings, these days. I would for sure put in for that.”\n\nCheeks still bulging, Barney Blimp conceded to full, unabridged eye contact with the weariness of ten millennia.\n\n“Dude, I’m definitely going to become a Free Fucking Mason, but I’m going to modernize their whole shit. Ham radio, you know – probably the most equally-obscured community for the general populace, equally obsessed with ciphers, and *certainly *the only respective equals in socially anti-social activity for old white men with Asperger’s.”\n\nA Freshman eyebrow was raised; the Freshman chewing, resumed, and the genius of The Junior Lazarus thought it would have a go at a bit of baity ignorance.\n\n“I mean, if we all really wanted walkie talkies for our treehouse clubs in Elementary school, then it would only make sense to launch the Masons onto the UHF band, right?”\n\n“VHF,” said Barney through two-day-old pork and peeled-away cheddar. “UHF is for TVs, radar, and cellular phones; *vee h eff* is ham radio.”\n\nLazarus bowed his head, smiled, and faced forward his palms, and thus – in the chemically vomit-scented lunchroom of Limon Junior-Senior High School – the socialization of Barney Blimp began with a bid to modernize the American Freemasons which – if pursued – would’ve proved to be in vain, for by then, in 2003, almost all of the membership had Hotmail accounts. Liam Libel – a Freshman that year, like Barney and by a wide berth the dirtiest of the *Six* – did not, but he *did *proudly maintain a subscription to *Reason *Magazine and communicated exclusively in savagely relentless Libertarian shouts. After his particularly-troubled World History teacher developed a gasoline drinking habit(fn) and fell tremendously ill over Winter break, Liam’s class was absorbed into Blimp’s, which was not much trouble logistically for such a moderately-sized student body, but *was* from day 1 significant trouble for Barney and his surrounding peers.\n\nThe new, consolidated 10:33AM World History block totaled thirty-three students, who were doing their best to *physically* and *spatially* consolidate as the last remaining teacher of World History employed at Limon Junior-Senior High School introduced himself.\n\n“Hello hello hello, welcome welcome,” cooed the diminutive man in that manner which only secondary educators do.\n\n“New folks, I’m Mr. Drake – hello hello hello and *wel*come back… Yes, sorry about the space… It looks like everybody’s doing a great job… Good job managing… This is only for a few weeks, don’t worry… Yes, please do your best to settle in… Yes, hello hello hello, you’re in the right place! Welcome welcome welcome *back*… I’m Mr. Drake.\n\n“Before we get started with the curriculum for this semester… It won’t be all that different from what it would’ve been if… And I promise you it won’t be further complicated if and when we move to new rooms, of course, so don’t worry about that… I just wanted to talk about a few policies specific to *my* class for the new folks… A brush up for the rest of you, of course, he he…”\n\nMr. Drake hobbled all around his desk, the projector, then to the door, which he unpropped with his right moccasin and began to close but reconsidered with an audible *hm* and shuffled awkwardly to open and prop again with a kick of his *left* moccasin, mumming *hm* again, hobbling his way to the thermostat, which he dramatically leaned back, then forwards, then back again to examine, adjusting his glasses and wedging his right hand flat against his kidney to form a tea kettle handle. He looked that way at it for a few seconds before he attempted to begin another thought, aloud.\n\n“*Aaaaaand* we’re just going ta… mmhmm, so it looks like… It looks like… I’m going to keep this turned down just so ah… We’re going to keep the thermostat turned down for now… I think there are enough of us to keep it quite warm in here… Of co-… Ah… Of course, if anybody starts to get especially chilly… Chilly, just let me know.”\n\n“So!” he said, turning to the squirming, now mildly claustrophobic class for the first time, folding his glasses again.\n\n“I want to begin by talking about the *future* a little bit, if that’s okay with everybody… Our terrible future! In which we will all be *ruled* by these little things!” He produced a scuffed silver flipphone from the black leather holster on his belt.\n\n“Even now, the common man is surrounded by so many things he just cannot understand. His cellular telephone, his car, his home computer… It's hard not to wonder what exactly goes through mom and dad’s minds when they see them operate, huh? It must be reduced down to… Almost superstition, you know? Nothing Voodoo, mind you, but – in some way, deep in the mind of the average schmuck, his cellular telephone is quickly becoming his god.”\n\nMr. Drake returned the phone to its holster and looked behind him to retreat enough to sit on his rough, pockmarked, and splintery cherrywood desk as Mr. Libel himself huffed through the door with a pronounced, angsty furrow in his brow, his right arm holding the sling of his ratty tote over the right shoulder of his even rattier creamy brown leather jacket. Even faced with the density of desks and flustered teens, he did not pause even though one would assume it was surely necessary.\n\n“Hello hello hello… Welcome, welcome,” said Mr. Drake more quickly, his head tracking Liam’s ungainly slotting upon a free, deskless chair against the farthest wall between twin spectacled boys with matching curly blonde afros, just behind Barney, followed by the careless thudding of his bag on the foot-worn carpet in front.\n\n“Right!” continued Mr. Drake from his perch. “And for you, it will become a god also, but one of a different sort… Many Godly persons desire their particular deity to do the work; to only interact with what’s on the surface, but you! You hold our newfound technological god as one to be known! And that is exactly how it should be… Not just for the sake of the knowledge, itself, but for the betterment of our lives… Now…”\n\nHe placed both palms on his desk and leaned forward.\n\n“Before we again begin with our *history*, I want to tell you something very important… There’s a war on. And… You wanna know a secret?”\n\nSpeaking in a more whispery projection, he leaned his bald patch forward a bit more.\n\n“There’s a war on… There’s a war on you!” He thrusted his pointer finger at the class – who maintained a collective stoicism – as he hopped again to his feet and began pacing, hands together behind him.\n\n“It’s on everyone who thinks… Everyone young who learns! It’s on everyone with progress on their minds… It’s a war waged even on knowledge, itself… A war of ignorance.”\n\nMr. Drake paused, swiveling his gaze on his heels, gray eyes wide. In the rear, Liam scoffed loudly over the disinterested silence, slouched all the way back in his rigid chair and hoisting his legs to cross them on Barney’s left shoulder.\n\n“Ay, YO TEECH,” he yelled in Mr. Drake’s general direction, glancing left and right. “YO TEECH, you blaze tron?”(fn)\n\nMr. Drake, frozen in the forward stoop he’d been glaring from, offered no reply. Barney brushed briskly at Liam’s Converses against his head as if they were a lost lunar moth.\n\n“Yo teech, you just tell me if you want a little somun somun, you know what I mean,” Liam said, *Ha Ha*ing with his right hand eclipsed over his smile.\n\n“Dude,” Barney complained. Libel sat up again and returned his feet to the floor, but didn’t otherwise acknowledge the protest. He threw his right arm into an arc over his head and made his hand into a vague pistol shape, pointed at Mr. Drake.\n\n“Ay, YO TEECH… BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVENA RON PAUL… Ha ha! YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY… THIS COUNTRY GOIN TO SHIT, *MAN*.”\n\nMr. Drake self-consciously returned to standing upright, but his eyes looked miles beyond the far wall and his students – thirty-one of whom had yet to react at all.\n\n“Why is it ALWAYS BOXES, *man*? What’s with the FUCKIN BOXES? YO TEECH, THIS SOME BULLSHIT.”\n\nBarney set about gathering his things to escape the tirade, but Liam had begun to violently writhe about in his chair and appeared to be quickly descending into a fit, which exponentially slowed Blimp’s organization.\n\n“DON’T DO THIS, TEECH. DON’T LABEL ME!”\n\nHis whole body was convulsing now and his magazines were bounding and bouncing toward serious altitudes on top of him like wheat chaff as it’s shaken free of the grain.\n\n\"AY YO TEECH… WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THESE CAGES ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK.\"\n\nAnd with that, his chair failed him as he shook to the ground on his hands and knees – still hollering in bodily tumult.\n\n\"COME ONNNN*NNNN* TEECH, YOU KNOW I CAN’T FIT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT BOX,” he spat at the rug. Neither Mr. Drake nor his pupils had moved or expressed anything, save for Barney Blimp, who stepped over Liam Libel with his backpack and threaded his way strenuously through the desks and static legs, feet, and empty faces through the door. A hundred yards down the hallway, as he leaned against the exit, a final croaking throw came from behind him.\n\n“*Ron Pal!*”\n\nThe creaking of the exit door – hinges wanting for a greasing – and the *swooshing* of its bottom seal against the muddy black shoemat yielded not for Barney Blimp the fresh Colorado air and lucid sunshine, but instead – through a haze of drug-numbed internal retching and destruction – the stagnantly sterile, ammonia’d atmosphere and lifeless colors of a meager hospital room. From the open hallway to his left came an ambiently echoing broadcast of unexpected contextual quality.\n\n“Welcome, Frances Fujica Chamberlain, eleven pounds, six ounces,” said a theatrically raspy woman’s voice, followed by a pleasantly rhythmic rock sample.(fn)\n\n“*BLINDed by the light */ *revved up like a deuce */ *another roller in the night!*”\n\nYet, it was the tiny wall-mounted television that captured Barney’s newly-awoken, moderately-medicated attention. From diagonally across his tall bed with its faded floral sheets and itchy medium blue comforter, the minuscule CRT blared a top-of-the-hour *Good Morning America *graphic.\n\n“Good morning, America. Breaking news, the FBI takes on Apple demanding the tech giant help with a terror investigation. Are critical clues to more plots hidden on the phone of the San Bernardino shooters? Why Apple's CEO is refusing to help this morning. A battle that could affect everyone with a smartphone,” said the voice of the aging anchor from under a dyed black combover to whom the introduction transitioned along with a lower third graphic that said “JAKE JINGLES, ABC NEWS.” *Apparently, it is the morning*, thought Barney Blimp.\n\n“Good morning,” he whispered. Jake Jingles and his co-host Jaime Jangles then went on about the idiosyncrasies of the G.O.P., quoted and played back a clip of the current President saying *I believe so and so will never be President*, then a shorter clip of “BJ, a German Shorthaired Pointer” – clearly somewhere else in the studio, sitting obediently, cocking his head at the approaching camera lens – before finally returning to a wide-shot of Jingles and Jangles sitting abreast, smiling off screen at the dog.\n\n“All right, and good morning, America. There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club's Best in Show Award. He's just arriving here in Times Square. He took a walk there on our green carpet in case you missed it. We cannot wait to meet the top dog coming up. Hear what he has to say about his win. The biggest bone of all.”\n\n“A great-looking dog.”\n\n“He walks like a winner.”\n\n“He is.”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“Amazing,” said Barney Blimp, all at once noticing how uncomfortable his entire physical being had been left in its current, awfully-upright position against a mountain of pillows that looked promising, but disappointingly lacked fulfilling qualities one tends to hope for and enjoy in promising-looking pillows. He lifted his rear to scoot it down and felt an unsettling tremor of his out of kilter equilibrium atop faint whole-body pins and needles from – no doubt – remaining more or less stationary for hours?...days?\n\n“…have more on that later. But right now lots of reaction coming in overnight to that emotional appearance in the White House briefing room from Chief of Staff Eggs White. The former general raw and red-eyed as he defended the President, attacked his critics, and remembered the death of his own son on the battlefield. Chief White House correspondent Geoffrey Gouge starts us off. Good morning, Geoff…”\n\nRealizing the excess of the television’s current volume was insistently coercing the entirety of his attention, Barney looked about him – despite the dizziness – searching for the remote control. To his left, there was only empty space and the burst of brief, sickly draft from a cycle of the neighboring Intensive Care Unit airlock; to his right, a substantially loaded IV pole holding both black and translucent liquid bags, and a hang-over eating tray on castors which was – quite strangely – surfaced in a bright, neon-green neoprene, and contained a small-book-sized touch tablet. He reached for it, tapping the black screen with his right index finger’s plastic heart-rate monitor in an attempt to illicit life. After a few clumsy tries, he achieved a sort of success: an awkward, large-print menu faded into view with five haphazardly off-center options next to hopelessly-scaled stock graphics: *DRUGS*, *MEDIA*, *BILLING*, *SCHEDULING*, and *SUPPORT*. Barney tried *MEDIA*, but the subsequently displayed controls were muted somehow – left transparent. No amount of tapping yielded any change in the program, which had turned to a montage of B-roll: red-faced parents talking on mobile phones on the black asphalt – crowded to the point of insanity by neutral-colored SUVs outside a sprawling red brick building sprouting the tiniest trickle of gray smoke from the far wing.\n\n“The driver, look at this, pulled over after he smelled smoke, and that's when flames erupted. More than a dozen students from the Jacksonville area high school had to evacuate. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The children were picked up by a different bus and taken home. No word on what caused this in the first place, but certainly glad everyone is okay this morning, Jake.”\n\n“Thank goodness for that. And now to that big win overnight for the Los Angeles Dodgers, heading to their first World Series since 1988,” continued Jake Jingles as the slightest electronic pseudodance percussion was subtly faded behind his voice in the background – its 140 beat-per-minute high hats abnormally flattered by the bias of the pitiful speakers within the wall-mounted unit, furthering Blimp’s aggravation with the situation. He amplified his aggression toward the tablet, holding it just inches from his nose as he pounded his fingers on the glass. The original menu came briefly back into view before the *DRUGS* option was selected, swapping the theme entirely for microscopic, illegible text and alarmingly primary reds. The unassuming white plastic pump suspended in the middle of his IV pole suddenly clicked and began a drawling, whirred chugging. Panicking at the sound and the new movements of fluids he perceived, Barney vigorously attacked the big red *X* in the top-right corner with every ounce of available effort left in the stumps of his thumbs, and was – to his gracious relief – rewarded with the cessation of the horrors.\n\n“…guy behind looked so concerned until the last second. Also right now a lot of reaction coming to that emotional moment in the White House press briefing room. Chief of Staff General White, defending the President's calls to the families of fallen soldiers. Also took on the President's critics and opened up about the loss of his own son on the battlefield…”\n\nBarney Blimp sighed in extreme exasperation and threw the tablet down on the tray, sinking under the sheets until his feet felt the footboard and hung over it, both hands desperately gripping the comforter, pulling it over his nose so that only his eyes-up were exposed. A new wave of drowsiness gushed from his numb belly and washed over him like sleepy molasses, tinging his vision light blue as he tilted it with his head on the flat bed below the pillow mountain to focus on a single one of the ceiling tile’s dark red polka-dots. *Spackled blood*, he thought – the removed Observer of his consciousness noting how much less anxious he was in the moment than he should’ve rationally been, while knowing, of course, that his state was entirely the result of whatever drugs they had him on.\n\n“Welcome, Leslie Désirée Lund, eight pounds four ounces… *BLINDed by the light*…”\n\nBarney Blimp’s eyes drooped heavy as his Observer ceased short its attempt to recollect the sequence of events which led him there – wherever *there* was – it was a bed… a less-than-moderately comfortable bed… and instead considered the definition of “roller” in “*another roller in the night*.” Not *roller* as in “high *roller*,” no. Not “*roller* blades,” though it… he… *they* had always wanted to learn how to inline skate… *Aggressive* inlines. Speed skating was such an elegant, lost art. Why weren’t there more speed skaters swooping and sliding around, bent over with their hands behind their backs to cut through the air oh-so-beautifully… in all State and National parks… in cardigans… and purple sweatbands? *What happened to them all?*\n\n“…and after the break, Jaime and I sit down with Theodore Pith, the young artificial intelligence pioneer and mogul, now author of a new book about cheese and the end of the world…”\n\nR-o-l-l-e-r, *roller*. A flour-dusted light wood cylinder with matching old style handles, loose… Loose, but that’s how they were supposed to be… how they had to be or else it would not roll separately of them… Except it was *huge*, and growing! Gargantuan! And the hands! Covered in dark black hairs of a simply *vulgar *length and nearly as big… Bringing the overwhelming girth of the surface – the *much *too *solid* and *threatening* surface – to flatten his body! Rhythmically rolling and squishing and flattening Barney Blimp and his organs against this awful, foreign bed like *fucking dough! *He was more conscious now, but still unable to move – completely paralyzed… And the hellish utensil was on its way back again! *Revved up like a deuce…* *The toes*, he remembered! He and his Observer concentrated everything they had on wiggling their toes… *really* wiggling… and finally… they wiggled alive!\n\nLiberated from his dream and waking paralysis, Barney shot up – sheets, comforter, tubes, cables, and all – inhaling massively only to see on the tiny wall television the pale, smiling face, flashing green eyes, and blood-red hair of his new boss sitting cross-legged in a purple chair astride the *GMA* watermark as the show returned from a commercial break. Opposite a table packed with granite-looking half-pipes full of steaming brown beans were the smooth faces of Jake Jingles and Jaime Jangles.\n\n“Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of the new, quite controversial but hot-selling book – especially here in New York, *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything*,” said Jake Jingles with occasion.\n\n*Fuck*, mouthed Barney Blimp.\n\n“…and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan barbecue joints, Pith's Chili Trough and Pith's Chili Playpen. We've got what looks to be a... Ha ha, well... a miniature *trough* of chili right here in front of us. Wow! A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith... Your book seems well… It seems to be in direct opposition to what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?”\n\n“SON OF A *FUCKING BITCH!” *screamed Barney, hoarsely. His hands moved to fumble with the tablet again, mouth agape as Jake Jingles fumbled similarly in propping an obnoxiously-covered volume upright for the camera, on screen, struggling to obscure an apparently-obscene illustration of a nude woman covered in cheese – his right hand accomplishing the censorship of all but her cheese-strung feet behind the title text.\n\n“Yes, that's an understandable contrast to make, Jack,” Pith answered as the broadcast switched to his full-shot angle. He himself was deeply contrasted with the formal wear of everyone present – save for some of the studio audience, perhaps – with his pale, freckled arms sticking out of a plain white t-shirt which said on its front in a loud, large, simple sans-serif typeface *TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH.*\n\n“First, I'd like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared... Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don't be shy – get your hands dirty! It's Chili Day!”\n\nTheodore Pith waved wildly and dumbly, gyrating both palms at the present audience, off screen, who whooped and cheered in response. Their audience camera was clumsily cut to a bit later than it should’ve been. Jake Jingles forced a chuckle.\n\n“Well, there it is... You've got to love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?”\n\nJaime Jangles chimed in with an addendum, first two right fingers drumming on her chin.\n\n“And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?” She gestured toward his torso, emptily smiling.\n\n“First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there... I'm actually going to start digging in, if you don't mind,” Theodore Pith said, shoving the provided logo-adorned bib under his right thigh.\n\n“No, of course... I think I'll join right in with ya,” replied Jake, who sat forward and looked helplessly at the massive task before him.\n\n“I, myself, really don't find the book's argument in conflict with my love of- and affection for chili, particularly.” He threaded the provided (and also logo-adorned) garden trowel under a great yellow-brownish gop of beans and scooped it toward his maw, spilling a few ounces on the oversaturated rug. Jake Jingles was having one hell of a time shoving his own logo-adorned bib into the front of his shirt without rubbing his live lapel microphone unnecessarily.\n\n“That argument being – as I understand having read as much as I could last night – that our obsession with food is... Well, sort of rampant and infecting our culture-”\n\n“...and stealing attention from important efforts in humanitarian policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you *do* finish the book – and I really hope you do, George, really… – you’ll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it is by now our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome's time to fall, if you’re catching my drift.”\n\nBarney Blimp was now a reddening, rigid live wire – his fury crossing a threshold in his heart monitor, setting off its alarm in triads. *Beepbeepbeep*.\n\nJake Jingles – now equipped properly with logo-adorned bib – looked across the table in building agitation at Theodore Pith, twirling his clean trowel. From beside him, Jaime Jangles – yet to be misnamed, and thus slightly less huffy – offered her intermediation.\n\n“I have to say... I haven't gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my Me Food – I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his *even more*, and it's hurtful, the suggestion that my interest in good food is somehow wrong or dangerous-”\n\n“...oh, James! Don't look so bashful! Please, do eat your chili!”\n\nThere was a great, gaping, deadly live television pause filled with the swishing and swashing of the pale Pith’s rhythmic chewing over the 140 beat-per-minute electro beat, his otherwise quiet person in frame, t-shirt now covered in brown, eyes cast downward to the half-empty trough before him.\n\nJaime Jangles cleared her throat.\n\n“I’m Jaime, actually…”\n\nThe eyes came up with a full mouth, from which hung a six-inch-long string of cheese.\n\n“...oh shit, I'm so sorry! That's really embarrassing...”\n\nTheodore Pith looked to her, then to the camera and back. Behind the camera, the audience conveyed together both amused applause and inverbal admonishment.\n\n“Jaime, please let me make it up to you… have some of *my* chili!”\n\nJingles and Jangles cringed, smiled, and managed chuckles with all the restraint in the world.\n\n“Hey, now! There are families watching this live, Mr.- ”\n\n“…gosh, I am so sorry.”\n\nTheodore looked to the camera covered in chili as the shot cycled back to him.\n\n“Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-”\n\n“…let’s just try and get back to the book, alright?”\n\n“Sure, sure... It's really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.”\n\nThe triplets of the Barney Blimp alarm had finally summoned a disheveled young orderly, who bussed immediately around the dismal bed to cease it in a blur of dark purple and Chanel No. 5.\n\n“Good, good! It’s good to see you up… Barney-“\n\n“Please turn off the television,” he said.\n\n“… I’m sorry?”\n\n“TURN *OFF*… the television. Turn off the TV, please.”\n\nThe orderly looked up from the tablet on her forearm to the screen, where Jaime Jangles was hesitantly playing with her little shovel.\n\n“Wow, yes, I can't even visualize… How long did the process take, do you know?”\n\n“At least three... Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was,” to *wows* from Jangles, Jingles, and the audience.\n\n“For God’s sake, turn… it… *OFF!*”\n\n“That's actually... really no time at all,” said Jake.\n\n“Really quick,” nodded Jaime.\n\n“OFF!” screamed Barney Blimp, in a single, swift motion picking up the tablet and hurling it – inches from the nurse’s nose – to a perfectly placed impact on the little TV, cracking its screen and inducing a brief blip of white noise blinds, yet neither the horrid appliance nor his visitor flinched a bit. The later calmly returned her attention to her own tablet, then to the IV pole’s machinery.\n\n“Mr. Blimp, please try to control yourself.”\n\nJake Jingles again stiffly manipulated the bright-orange volume, turning it in profile and then over, very deliberately assuring that the cheesy woman be excluded from the shot.\n\n“It's nearly five-hundred pages, right? And this is your first book?”\n\n“First *published* book under my own name, you know. I've written a few other things, here and there, but that's a subject for another time.”\n\n*Aw*, said the audience.\n\n“Sure, we’ve got to have you back some time,” said Jake Jingles with visible grit in his smile.\n\n“Jesus,” said Barney Blimp.\n\n“But, this apocalypse... Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or...?”\n\n“All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world…”\n\n“Mother*fucker.*”\n\n“…in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit... And yet, we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.”\n\nUp went the young woman’s eyebrows as she tapped her tablet, unpainted fingernails clacking.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry about the TV, but could you *please* just turn it off for me?”\n\n“A striking thought,” said Jake Jingles.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she replied, making eye contact for the first time, eyebrows erect with no minimum of patronization. “I can’t do that, Barney, but I *can* have something to eat brought up for you, if you’d like.”\n\n“*…another roller in the night!*”\n\n“Quite. And that was the idea, but it's also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope – that Rome's decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?”\n\n“Well, I'm glad you brought this chili with you... It *is* quite an achievement,” said Jaime Jangles, having eaten half a trowel’s worth.\n\n“How does that sound, huh…? It’s Chili Day!”\n\nBarney Blimp gripped the handles straddling his bed-bound prison so ferociously that he soon blacked out.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\n*Dr. Gravel, it is with great haste and discretion that I write you regarding a patient who was received in the care of St. Nicholas’ ICU on Thursday afternoon (the 8th) – Barney Barry Blimp, age 30 – with a few requests in the interest of his particular and quite consequential needs on behalf of his very long-time friend and employer, Mr. Theodore Pith, who is deeply distraught and regrets that he is unable contact you personally at this time. He is, however, willing, wanting, and able to allocate any and all necessary resources to ensure the fulfillment of these needs, including a prospective donation to the Kare 4 Kids fund and/or support of other/equivalent programs at St. Nicholas. Please contact me directly as soon as you are able so that we may further the discussion (the numbers for both my cell and personal extension at the Institute can be found at the end of this message.) Until then, it would be to Mr. Pith’s tremendous satisfaction and appreciation if you were to promptly act in your best ability to ensure the alterations to Mr. Blimp’s stay as follows…*\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIn the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*,(fn) Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.\n\nTheodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.\n\nIn the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.\n\nThe latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him(fn) – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.\n\n“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.\n\n…\n\n“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.\n\n…\n\n“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.\n\n“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”\n\n…\n\nFinally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.\n\n“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nUnable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*\n\n…\n\n“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”\n\nLenny Lather had not… *could not *have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.\n\n“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD *in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing *– hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.\n\nAs he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.\n\n“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.\n\n“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.\n\n“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”\n\n…\n\n“Right-o, as you say, sir!”\n\n…\n\n“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”\n\n…\n\n“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”\n\n…\n\n“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”\n\n…\n\nAfter the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors.(fn) The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.\n\n“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.\n\n“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.\n\n“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.\n\nAnd the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”\n\nThe Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.\n\n“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best *Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.\n\n“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People *Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.\n\nPerhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather.\n\n“Sir! Excuse me!”\n\n…\n\n“*Excuse me! *Sir!”\n\n…\n\nTheodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”\n\nKeys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”\n\n“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.\n\n“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.\n\n“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.\n\nAfter he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.\n\n“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.\n\n“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”\n\nThough the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.\n\nTwo days after they’d taken the third wheel, Theodore mailed to the store’s main address an anonymous bundle of cash totaling almost three times the sum value of the cheese “in interest,” which included a long, sappy letter addressed personally to the Artisan and went on and on about how he – the mastermind – had discovered in his crime the magic of her art, stating and restating in outpouring artisanal prose why she should never be afraid to put so much of herself in her perfect medium of expression – titanic wheels of five-figure cheese.\n\n“It’s not as if getting caught wouldn’t have been the absolute pinnacle of the thing,” he had suggested to Lenny that night over an uncharacteristically serene scotch in front of an uncharacteristically cozy wood and what had seemed to be – under all reasonable scrutiny – an uncharacteristically reflective and relatively sober Theodore Pith compared to the impressively consistent inconsistencies he’d been so far growing to expect.\n\n“Imagine being tried and convicted for *stealing cheese* and forevermore knowing you could choose to introduce yourself with the story of your brief, prolific success in a most 18th-century crime, and back it up with transcripts, newspaper clippings – even TV news stories, if you can pull it off… or, making for yourself the temporary obligation to explain in a job interview that yes, you did indeed have a recent criminal conviction on your record… for running out with *three wheels of cheese* from the same place in the same store within the same month.”\n\nThe noise of his own sobriety had been like a beehive with a tide in the back of his head, pulsing, ebbing, spiking, then fading – a buzzing multitude of footprints were the withdrawals left there by a diverse nature of substances. Some were more tangibly linked to physical sensations of vocally-specific need, as nicotine so quickly becomes and as alcohol shall be, one day, if you explicitly and repeatedly overdo it. Others left equally unpleasant sensations that could be – to the body – of an unknown cause entirely, like the sharpness of certain amphetamines, which we one can only miss consciously.\n\n“So, yes, incrimination and money are both more or less inconsequential, but why the apology?” he had asked through a dip in the amplitude of the tide. The scotch had seemed to be treating something. He had felt most of it in his toes.\n\n“And such an *extensive* apology… Was it guilt? Or do you just get off on your raw insincerity so blissfully that those hours of your time couldn’t have been spent on a single more pleasurable activity than writing a bullshit apology to a woman you’ve never met in which you expertly validate a worldview and a set of preferences that couldn’t possibly differ any more from your own?”\n\n“Both and neither,” Theodore had replied, pouring the last quarter of the bottle between them.\n\n“Guilt is nothing but regretful incompetence, which – depending on the perspective from which you classify – I may or may not experience or act from. From my own, I would argue that mitigating the possible damage done collaterally by a stunt like this is effort owed to *my own vanity* irrespective of the wellbeing of however many cheese-obsessive people may have been affected or not. Inadvertently harming some person or persons seriously – in spirit, mind, body, or all three – while spinning around a brass-headed cane and playing with a slippery monocle is just embarrassingly sloppy, primarily – and by its nature dull, unoriginal, and unnecessary.\n\n“My ability to balance out unforeseen consequences of my exploits is satisfying if only in its reinforcement of my control over my own impact on my environment. Theft as an abstract is always going to make the thief look weak in the end, no matter how much he may or may not be aggrandized in popular culture. Violence is vulgar, brutish, and uncivilized. Anybody can demoralize, steal from, or beat up anyone who happens to have less power at that moment – the power to alter perception, though, is the ultimate entertainment device.”\n\nIt had then occurred to Lenny through the noise of his extreme sobriety from all that was not scotch that he should’ve *definitely* been taking notes; that the chances of hearing Theodore so explicitly explain his truths ever again were virtually nill, and that he had been altogether *horrendous* at his profession since the World Trade Center had last towered over Manhattan, but before he had found the necessary bearings to further formulate any sort of rectifying action, he’d lost consciousness there in front of that supremely cozy fire.\n\nAnd now, as he walked with a certain glee through his nocturnal space by the more concentrated softened yellow of the “Nature Observatory”(fn) with a leather-bound journal and a golden-nibbed pen in the big front pocket of his beige utility jacket – despite enduring the downward slope of the amphetamine and laudanum concentration in his blood – he was yet unprepared by what there was of these in him, still, to comprehend his own incompetence. Though he could recall that brief, noisy consumption of his truth by his own sober measure, he was spared the obligation of understanding it, or worse – *using* the pen and the journal to articulate it in a way he would not be able to forget. Nevertheless, the cheese heists were definitively the most fun he could remember having, for reasons which he did not find important enough to justify disturbing his deserved respite from the burden of words.\n\nOften, Pith would blast both sides of two or three early-90s, edgy sample-speckled Australian rave cassettes at deafening volume from the parlor while he stomped around reading real-estate trade journals until he’d pass out and fall face-first into the polished oaken floor, the towering wall shelves of collectible classics, or – if his luck happened to be severely deficient – some piece of dark, dense, hundred-year-old furniture, where he would remain for twenty or thirty hours in deep recovery sleep. Lenny Lather did his best to take advantage of these lapses in his supervision by wandering the great old house, sifting through what of Theodore Pith’s possessions that could be considered personal or intimate – the great Guttenberg, where it lay spread open on a pulpit in the corner of the library most of the time when the Master was at home – and the numerous lesser instances of Theodore’s blasphemy, which he’d originally supposed to have gone forgotten as the toys belonging to a child of plenty often do, but the few tests to which Lenny Lather had subjected his memory so far had been unsuccessful in shaking loose any neglected ends. It seemed that he had not forgotten even his most petty, miniscule acts of obtuse indiscretion, chaotic disruption, or perplexing inconvenience, due in no small part to the odds and ends contained within the expanses and crannies of *Nice, Big*’s nearer and further quarters, most now repurposed (although not all permanently) into personal galleries.\n\nNothing so unseemly as Holy shrines, their walls were covered by and large with great photographic prints themed as you’d expect within the rooms of the manor of an elderly aristocratic globetrotter with a penchant for civic engineering and local media. There was *The Obits Room*, covered in magnified prints of southern Wyoming newspaper clippings(fn) in minimal black matte frames over floor-to-ceiling pink identical to the color of a popular antacid, which unsettled Lenny Lather’s core to no end – the gastrointestinality of the matching furniture and linens made him feel as if he was being digested in the huge stomach of a heinous mutant with an appetite for sentimental rural memoriam. Closer scrutiny of the text – as was encouraged upon the first stop of his first tour of the estate, being a newsman himself – would reveal that it was less than legitimate, at best.\n\n“Every business quarter,” Theodore Pith had explained with a certain glee, “I require a staffer from a sequentially-chosen one of my papers to write and publish their own obituary. It helps keep one’s perspective fresh, don’t you think?”\n\nNaturally, as a quite recent acquaintance and grateful guest in his home, Lenny Lather had politely and absentmindedly agreed, while internally, he had entertained the all-too-resonant thought that he had been writing his own obituary for years, yet – to whatever extent he was himself aware of it – he was the only individual for which Theodore Pith was inexplicably tempted by sincerity, and thus eager to sate his resulting curiosity. It was not clear whether or not he enjoyed the innkeeper role, or – especially at the origin of their meeting – anything which could be substantially shared at all, really.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nBarney Blimp had already scratched and felt for the back of his neckline several times, assuming it was the tag of this – his favorite navy blue t-shirt – that was causing the irritation, but as he wiggled to reach it again, he felt prickling and motion. Startled and sweaty, he swung his shoulders wide and propped himself against the rim of the bathtub with his right elbow, turning his body, head, and eyes toward their extremes to see that it was nothing but a Poinsettia, potted in golden foil-wrapped plastic atop the lid of the toilet tank so that its especially scratchy green, red-spattered leaves protruded well into the space of any occupant who happened to get comfortable enough on the pot to lean at all back.\n\n“This is insane! You are all *actually* insane,” came the unusually crass whine of Lazarus’ little brother – whom Barney had always struggled to name since they’d yet to have a significant interaction in the two years he’d been coming over – through the bathroom door from the kitchen.\n\n“Yes, you’ve got it so hard, don’t you? You know, when I was your age, I had to save my own money from the car wash for two summers just so I could pay for my own trip – *bus ticket included* because *my *parents wouldn’t set aside the time to take me themselves… to Blackload on the third,” replied the booming baritone of Mr. Luger, with whom Barney Blimp and the rest of *The Limon 6* – including his own son, Lazarus – avoided eye contact if at all humanely possible. He’d slid up from the basement over half an hour before and was long finished with his business, but the notion of traipsing right through the middle of the family dispute to get to the basement stairs – which was directly open to their argumentative kitchen – had paralyzed him there, waiting for a resolution or some equivalently appropriate opportunity to return back to the social safety of the *Smash Bros.* game on the downstairs TV. The side effects of his anxiety were then further exacerbated by the stillness of the humid heat in the Luger house, which was never within much of a confined temperature, as suburban houses purposely tend to be. Though theirs was by far the largest, most convenient, and most accommodating gathering place offered by the parents of the *6*, it managed in many subtleties – like the nagging placement of the Poinsettia plant, the air of disuse created by the stubborn geometric perfection of the vacuum rows left in the unblemished white carpet, and the required assistance of an occupant to navigate the particulars of either entrance – to be just uncomfortable enough to discourage one from spending large, unbroken blocks of time within it. It was an especially searing July evening in Limon – outside, the turbulent energy was just beginning to bleed off from the earlier one-hundred degree high, yet throughout Barney Blimp’s extended bathroom stay, the wide brown vent before him had yet to offer any cooling pity for the sweatsoaked, red-cheeked teen.\n\nFrom the kitchen came a huff and an obnoxious tirade of shuffling papers.\n\n“Well I think things have changed, *Dad*,” whined the smallest Luger again. “Do you remember the old brochure having a flying saucer with a crucifix insignia? Do you remember it mentioning ‘preparing oneself to graduate from the physical to the purely psychospiritual realm?’”\n\n…\n\n“Or saying anything about bringing ‘only the most sentimental touchstones and humble garments the child wishes to carry with them to the other side?’”\n\n…\n\n“Or how about the following sentence, which reads ‘though the child may choose to bring these for comfort, they may also choose to come to us unsoiled and unclothed, as they came to the physical Earth; as they shall leave it as childs and pilgrims of Blackload,’ huh? Does that sound right to you, Dad?”\n\n…\n\n“Look, I think they’re just tryin’ to say in a clever and funny way that’cha cain’t bring ya Gameboy, son.”\n\nThrough his nose to maintain his stealth, Barney Blimp sighed. His thighs were beginning to stick bothersomely to the toilet seat and – in his eavesdropping’s intense fixation – he’d been fooled twice again by the unmannerly plant. He reached behind him and moved it to the bathtub, taking great care to set it silently down. From under the floral tiles beneath his jean-topped sneakers came an unintelligible shout from Liam in the basement along with the easy low frequency *knock knocks* of East coast hip-hop. He leaned forward to slide the slats of the lifeless grate open in time to hear “…without rule of law,” and closed it again. Carefully holding the loose steel clasp of his belt to keep it from jingling, he rose, deliberately did up his clothes, and stepped at once to the shag mat in front of the plain white door.\n\n“I don’t care… Anything else! *Literally* anything else, Dad!”\n\nBarney grasped the brass doorknob gradually so as not to wiggle it within its execrable bracket and turned smoothly out the bolt so that he could crack it open just enough to see the kitchen counter.\n\n“Look… I’m not trying to be the bad guy here, you know,” said the huge Mr. Luger more somberly now from where he was stationed with his coffee mug by the empty sink. “I never had so much fun as I did at Blackload, I don’t think, and it’s not like I could *ever go again*. Think about that!”\n\n…\n\n“Never! No matter how much I paid or pleaded, and *oh man*, I wish I could… You bet… Sure do… You got no idea.”\n\nSitting on the opposite four-legged stool with only the short spikes of his gelled scalp and the back of his gargantuan *M\\*A\\*S\\*H- *t-shirt facing Barney’s crack was the befuddled Little Luger.\n\n“Dad… I can’t go to this. I will go *anywhere* else! *Vacation bible school*, Dad! I will go to vacation bible school!”\n\n…\n\n“I would rather *waste my whole summer *in the church basement watching *The Lion King* a billion times with braindead toddlers if you want, but you *can’t* make me go to Blackload.”\n\n…\n\nBarney’s observation was abruptly soiled by a broiling spike of agony from his abdomen so consuming and intense that a shrill yelp leapt out of his mouth through his peeping gap directly at the talking two in an extended, dramatic resonance. And yet – as the spike melted as quickly as it had sprung into a dull, wet ache – he noticed that they had not reacted to the cry, nor turned to discover him. *This is odd*, he thought, but the garbled sounds their two mouths now emitted were stranger still – gibberish, indecipherable – yet within the maintained tonality, though, of their respective pouter and soother positions within the summer camp debacle. Barney Blimp tried to inspect his ears with both probing pinky fingers, but they were much too big to fit.\n\n“Eeg,” said Little Luger in protest, gesturing angrily at the pamphlet in front of him.\n\n“Eeg,” his father responded, leaning his large belly and mug over the counter, obediently inspecting the literature in apparent confounding thought. Motion in Barney’s periphery moved his attention from the two to the mouth of the stairwell across the kitchen to their left, where – through the gaps between the white support legs of its border railing – a suspended silver cylindrical condenser microphone floated fluidly, slowly upwards, rising up the slope of the stairs, its head and illuminated green power-indicating light facing the pair as they continued arguing obliviously in tongues. As it crept, its mount and adjacent black metal pole stand came into his view – steadily on its careful course – then a white hand with red painted nails; the tip top of Lexi’s blond bowl cut and elven ears. From the bathroom door, Barney saw her stop just short of peeking above the kitchen floor, her grip for an instant wavering before all sound and motion ceased – at once, father and son stopped speaking and looked fast at the microphone where it hung just below the wood rail, recording them.\n\nThe three were trapped as such for an epoch: the father, against the counter, face toward the invading equipment without expression; the son, opposite him and looking also with his chin on his thumbs; Lexi, out of their line-of-sight, held fast, and then retreating down with the contraption at the pace she had come, descending with the device, which the duo followed in unison with only their eyes as it went down beneath the floor again.\n\n“Boop!” said a damp voice from ahead. Cold bone pushed on Barney’s nose and it all went black and under, then yellow again. He sniffled and it was rubber – the odor of a high school gym. “*Boop!*” again, and the breath was louder, but he shot open his eyes and grabbed the bone. It was an unhealthily yellowed index finger attached to the strangely-balding man above him and his graph paper collar, grinning gray teeth, and a cleft chin.\n\n“Good morning, Barney, my friend,” he said, “it is the time for you to awaken.”\n\n“Egch,” was all the reply he was obliged, for the abdomen ache had been mortally enlarged and was again returning – with its grimacing victim – to life. Barney involuntarily abandoned his hold on the man’s finger to hold with both hands his own tortured middle.\n\n“Fuck. Ow,” he groaned.\n\n“*There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club’s Best in Show Award*…”\n\nIn front of his clutched stomach and the white floral slopes of his blanketed knees and feet was the hellish appliance – the tiny, cracked television, now strapped on top of a distressed black metallic cart with the wide dirty yellow band of a tow rope, placed so close as to be in apparent contact with the foot of his hospital bed, which had been wheeled into a windowless, much more sinister space. The tiles of the ceiling were stained all over and the faded custard wallpaper was contemptuously torn in the far corner from the obscured doorway behind a gigantic, crosshatched pile of wooden and blue plastic clipboards that filled most of the unevenly lit floor space – certainly taking up half as much again the space made for Barney Blimp and company.\n\n“*A great-looking dog*.”\n\n“*He walks like a winner*.”\n\n“For God’s sake… Who… the hell… are… you people?” he asked with great effort, wincing through his teeth. The yellowed man had turned his daft, gray grin away and flipped through the crisp paper sheets on the clipboard in his forearm’s crook, pausing to belch once, twice, and thrice, churning his chin into many again and again with his nodding.\n\n“Barney, wow… It’s good to see you up and at’em again, eh?... I’m Dr. Bill, a resident psychiatrist here at St. Nicolas General.”\n\n…\n\n“Dr… Bill-”\n\n “…Dr. William Gravel, that is.”\n\n…\n\n“Why… have I been moved? What… the *hell* is this room? The pain…”\n\nDr. Gravel looked his way again with unsettlingly white eyes, belching under his breath, emptily grinning.\n\n“Ah, well, this is Clipboard Locker three, you see… Didn’t think these just appeared willy nilly outa thin air, didja? A*ha*,” he laughed hollowly and briefly held up his board in displayed emphasis before licking quickly his fingers in that foulest of fingery quick-licking ticks found in far too many of the most off-putting people, returning them then to vile scrunching and rubbing of what was presumably Barney Blimp’s medical chart.\n\n“At this point,” he said, chin retreating in another emission, “we moved you here, you see… because there seemed to be a problem when we tried to run your insurance, I’m afraid.”\n\n“You… what? You… can’t… you can’t do that?”\n\n…\n\n“Oh jeez, I’m really sorry Barney, buddy… At this point, I’m afraid we can’t give you anything more for the pain until you answer a few questions for me… Don’t worry, though, we will get it all figured out in no time at all.”\n\n“…*The former General raw and red-eyed as he defended the President*…”\n\n“At this point… I’d like to formalize things, if you don’t mind,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and clicking his ballpoint repeatedly after dismounting it from the board. “Uh… Give me just a moment… uhhuh.”\n\n“…*Good morning, Geoff*…”\n\nThe doctor marched around the bed, scooting and flattening himself between the TV cart and the decrepit wall, briefly disappearing behind the cover of a filthy old-fashioned hospital screen to produce a rolling chair with matching white leather upholstery.\n\n“…*The driver, look at this*…”\n\nBoth the hinges and the cracking cushion creaked as he sat, leaning at once much too far back, then regaining balance with his lifted legs and a loathsome “*whoopsie!*” Barney Blimp, still clutching, set to sucking in a great, to-capacity breath.\n\n“TURN OFF THE FUCKING…” he screamed.\n\n“*Hel*lo, aha,” said Dr. Gravel, with his chins and his belching.\n\n…\n\n“Good afternoon, Mr. Blimp, I am Dr. William Gravel, resident psychiatrist at St. Nicolas. At this point, I’d like to conduct your initial examination interview, if that’s alright with you. How are you feeling today?”\n\n“Hello, Bill. Turn off the fucking TV please.”\n\n…\n\n“I’m sorry?”\n\n“For the love of God, turn off the fucking television… Right *there*!” yelled Barney, sitting up with all his effort, indicating with both outstretch hands to the blabbering set at his feet, palms pleading toward the ceiling stains, “RIGHT *THERE*… TURN. IT. OFF.”\n\n“Gee, Barney…” said Dr. Gravel, following his patient’s desperately distressed eyes, “I can’t really do that at this point, I’m afraid… That TV is part of this whole regimen… You need it! You need it to feel better.” He and his chins belched on his board and again his fingers performed the quick-licking tick. Barney Blimp – having exhausted the energy he had saved in his rage – flopped back in on his unfulfilling pillows, moaning.\n\n“*We’ve got what looks to be a… Ha ha, well… a miniature *trough\\* of chili right here in front of us. Wow!...\\*”\n\n“At this point,” belch, licking tick, “I'm going to ask you a few questions that may seem a bit silly, but it's important that you try to answer them honestly and accurately, okay? We can laugh about them, no problem, but the actual answers from you need to be serious ones, if you can, okay?”\n\n“…*Yes, that’s an understandable contrast to make, Jack*…”\n\n“Let’s begin with your name. Can you tell me your full name?”\n\n…\n\n“Barney… Barry… Blimp,” he answered, clutching his middle again and looking serenely at the front of Theodore Pith’s t-shirt on the TV with just his neck.\n\n“Excellent, Barney… Okay, now… Today’s date?”\n\n…\n\n“Barney?... The date, buddy.”\n\n…\n\n“Saturday… March tenth.”\n\n“Perfect,” said Dr. Gravel, belching and scribbling with his crude, scratching instrument.\n\n…\n\n“And, can you tell me where we are now?”\n\n…\n\nAmidst a chorus of agony and new epiphany, Barney laid back flat and began shuffling downward in his bed toward the cart by gyrating his hips.\n\n…\n\n“Barn*ey*, can you tell me where you are? Maybe what this room is?”\n\n…\n\nGrunting and breathlessly cursing, the shuffling progressed steadily and Barney’s feet soon escaped the floral sheets, exposed toes touching the cold metal cart.\n\n“…*Well, there it is… You’ve got to love that humor!*...”\n\n“Alrighty, then, why don’t we come back to that one? No problem at all, buddy… How about the President? Can you tell me who the President is right now?”\n\n…\n\nSatisfied with his distance from the box and grimacing, Barney dug in his elbows and pushed against the towering black object of his torture with the gowned-above-the-knees might and unabashed howling of childbirth, tipping it insufficiently at first, then allowing it to swing back against the bed before adding all available gumption to the assisting action of his knees.\n\n“…*What kind of a shirt is that?*...” asked Jaime Jangles in finality as she fell back out of Barney’s sight with the thing, crashing, buzzing, and then entirely quieting, to his short-lived relief.\n\n…\n\n“*Whoopsie!*” belched Dr. Gravel.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nOn a clear day in the springtime, the United States Air Force Academy just north of Colorado Springs is an unequaled, head-looseningly airy and metallic experience with its acres of flat, entirely rectangular aluminum-covered facilities(fn) devoid of all but the most nominal distinguishing features, low and wide, but architecturally focused to culminate in its famous chapel – the historic purebred brutalist structure at the geographic center of the Cadet Area designed by architect Walter Netsch, who could not have delivered a single more effective symbol of traditionalist American values redressed and repurposed into a gargantuan armored war machine. On this early afternoon, two pair and one threesome of seamless khaki-wrapped Cadets walked measuredly around the intensely reflective white rectangular concrete circuit toward which the chapel doors faced inward and its monolithic presence loomed, smiling more than seemed reasonable in their surroundings, reflecting even more of the unencumbered sun off of their perfectly white teeth up the naturally-bordering hill of the West edge, where Lily Tharp and Theodore Pith leaned their folded forearms against the thick concrete wall of the elevated walkway and squinted(fn) toward the bizarre scene below.\n\n“I do wonder where they get so much of whatever it is they have,” said Pith.\n\n“They’re just kids,” replied Lily.\n\n“Kids with gifted IQs, perfect eyesight, above-average reflexes, and completely neurotypical brain function, yeah.”\n\nA breeze shifted and spiraled from the first corner of the path from around the hill’s base, 300 yards behind them, buffeting Theodore’s Curls and whipping stray strands about Lily’s bun.\n\n“I could’ve done it. Probably still could. I’ve heard they never stopped requiring fighter pilots to take Adderall, though.”\n\n“I believe all’a that. We could go down and ask for a hookup but I think that church must be a complex surveillance apparatus of some kind… I’m surprised they let us roam around this close, unsupervised.”\n\nA red-tailed hawk’s shadow panned along the bottom edge of their entranced vision and they both looked up – hands to their foreheads for shade – just in time to see its splayed feather wingspan descend behind the far side of the chapel, out of sight.\n\n“Do you actually want to learn to fly? I could pay for it, you know,” Pith asked, glancing imprecisely in her more sunlit direction.\n\n“You’d just demand that I fly you everywhere.”\n\n…\n\n“That’s not true in the slightest, but I would definitely expect a ridealong or two during which you allow me to screw around on the radio.”\n\n…\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever been anywhere like this.”\n\n“It’s like a future caste of technocatholic elites built an industrial Eden on the top of a mountain above the clouds.”\n\n“Yeah, my Uncle said he was an officer, but I don’t think he could miss mentioning this place.”\n\n“Ya know… it reminds one a lot of-”\n\n“Workin’ on it.”\n\n“Well, thanks. It’s just a really exciting prospect to restore something like that… Open it up to exhibits, even? I would be the God of hams for the rest of time.”\n\n“And if, indeed, I am able to actually acquire for you the ownership of what was not-so-long-ago top-secret acreage containing top-secret equipment within a foreign nationally-sealed exclusion zone, *I* will be *your* God.”\n\n“That’s very true.”\n\n“Though technically, they’ve only continued to maintain the zone out that far because it’s become a wildlife refuge.”\n\n“Which would be even more difficult to swing were it legally classified as such.”\n\n“Ah, well… If it happens, it happens.”\n\nFour of the walkers had departed the circuit, but the group of three was having another go, one of whom was walking backwards, toe-to-heel in front of them, telling an animated story with his napkincap in his fist. Theodore Pith inhaled deeply and cupped his hands into a cone around his mouth, which he pointed straight at the gaggle and *screeched* at an inhumanly high frequency for just a quarter second before jerking around to look up the hill behind him, enacting bewilderment. He saw the sound had distracted and slowed the Cadets and turned their smiles to mild puzzlement.\n\n“Let’s go find a drink somewhere,” he said.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nChief Technical Officer Peter Built had planned to be unreachable for at least an entire workweek – if not eternity – after the fateful Thursday when the billionaire and Barney Blimp had made a joke of his career and shit on his conference table in a single morning, but come noon on Monday, he woke up in his bathtub – pruned and badly chemically burned from the bleach he’d poured in at the end of the previous evening – to a backlog of incoherent emails, texts, and voicemail messages – mostly from Madge Teeth – in which she sounded far more ecstatically surprised than he’d ever actually heard from a human being, though completely and entirely incoherent, as if she’d taken a humongous dose of Peyote. When he managed to log in to the office chat server on his smartphone with what remained of the dissolving flesh of his thumbs, he was whole-body astonished to find the routine passive aggressive cross-department correspondence and bullshit Associate question volume he’d have expected by this time on every Monday before this one for as long as he could remember.\n\nAfter a brief and frank internal debate between his extreme exasperation with existence and immense curiosity over how and why the office he’d seen totally annihilated just four days before appeared to have returned to normal work, he resolved that he was much too pruned and uncomfortable to kill himself, so he began upon the task of gathering up the layers of drooping red skin in his arms to escape from the acrid tub, sloshing the terrible fluid about the linoleum as he stepped heroically onto the large pile of smoldering ashes of the self-help books he’d burned on the tile during his strange last-night rituals. Stopping by the master closet, he walked in to find it totally emptied of both his and Ingrid’s belongings – including hangers – and containing only in its very center her pet tarantula, Bo, who looked solemn.\n\nHe’d even left the gas stovetop on, hoping to leave Earth in a fireball, but the burners had been inexplicably lit without any evidence of combustion, so they’d accomplished nothing but running up the bill all night. After some seriously effortful nude recollection and a few swigs of isopropyl alcohol from under the kitchen sink, he remembered one hateful diving trip with his in-laws in the summer of 2007 and dashed across the house, dripping to the garage, where his car was still parked in the far space, *thank Gourd*, though heavily vandalized. Ingrid, he assumed, had used the can of John Deere Yellow spraypaint he’d bought years ago (intending to touch up a large scratch on the flank of a riding mower which they no longer owned) to write *S C R U B* across the already-filthy vehicle’s left side. This indecency, however, he barely registered. Instead, he approached the space under the high shelf in the far corner and jumped repeatedly into the plywood wall, grabbing for the ratty, disfigured cardboard box resting atop it. It inched forward as he leapt again and again, heaving and sweating naked bleach droplets until the dusty-ass hunk finally fell upon him, breaking open upon its contact with the concrete to reveal a filthy, cobweb-covered wetsuit.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nIt was an amalgamation of partial Limon truths, now – images of faces, landmarks in different seasons, and fragments of specific memories colliding with each other in continually-upended attempts to align cohesively: Leona, Lexie, and Leo smoking ditchweed from a one-hitter on a cloudy Fall evening at the y-lot; confronting Liam after class with Lazarus about the cruelty in shooting his dad’s cows with a BB gun for sport; riding a flea-infested queen mattress towed behind Lexi’s boyfriend’s loud little pickup truck through suburbia like a raft; picking up a free piano from a classified ad only to destroy it in the park with its own legs the same day, *screaming* in a frenzy for the camcorder; his quaint, speedy mother – either completely understanding his time of need to explore and dissect his selves, or simply… not, but always as present as she could possibly be. In retrospect, it was always much more of the first.\n\nGradually, sounds somewhere between familiar music and familiar voices joined with the collage to produce an immensely powerful, unexpected ache which Barney Blimp had not experienced in so long he’d all but forgotten its sensation. It was deepening like vertigo, but warm – a sore release. It lapped up his heart and ran down his limbs until his toes buzzed before it all circled back to his nose as its focal point, unleashing huge waves of nostalgia on the rich anomalous presence of his favorite smell: wood-smoked barbecue in the late-evening Fall chill, which he both celebrated and desperately mourned because it could never, ever be recreated as it was supposed to be – *with *those it was supposed to be. He began to grow quickly angry at his subjection to this ache unnecessarily.\n\n*And then there was light* and the dream’s smell was replaced by the imponderous and much less activating odor of diluted disinfectant as Barney caught his bearings enough to realize he was back upstairs in his original room at St. Nicholas, but the television was gone, and his remaining abdominal discomfort was tiny and dull. A thunderstorm was just concluding its business outside his window, and for a moment he felt confident that he would be able to coax the pressure in his throat to the surface and finally get some long-overdue crying out of the way, but he lost his grip and it slipped curtly back into his familiar state of generalized rage.\n\nThe Hell Tablet from before had been replaced on the mounted swinging tray by his own smartphone, which had even been plugged into an outlet to charge. For a moment, he considered if *Good Morning America*, Dr. Gravel, and Clipboard Room #3 had been nothing more than a wild fever dream – perhaps even Theodore Pith and his destructive office breakdown! Picking up the handset, though, he realized that it was not his, but in fact an unused example of its successive generation that had been restored from whatever was left of his old device after he pillaged MapQuest. Unlocking it, he was made immediately uneasy noticing that eight whole days had passed since the last time he remembered being conscious, and even more so by the first email in his inbox.\n\nTo: barn@mapquest.com  \nFrom: t@pi.th  \nDate: Friday, 03/16/2018 1647  \nSubject: Get well soon/updates on the future!\n\nBarney!\n\nI’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to be introduced formally.

I’ve had an interesting first week here at MapQuest, but from what I’m hearing, it sure sounds like this office just isn’t the same without you around!

Pith\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nBy the Monday after *The Incident*, MapQuest’s new Chief Operating Officer, Lily Tharp had remotely arranged the significantly expedited insurance appraisal, cleanup, refinishing, repainting, refurnishing, remodeling, and re-equipment of the 1555 Baker St. office with modernized server architecture, desktop machines, and state-of-the-art Enterprise-class laser printers from her smartphone on the road. The space’s new look was a reimagination of the previous design, drawing from the same color palette, but darkened and shifted, and its haphazardly speckled light wood deleted in favor of matte black sound-absorbing and soft-touch alcantara. Arriving minutes after sunrise, Lily was the first to experience the results of her work, and the smell of new paint combined with the young day’s light to present a rejuvenated MapQuest that wasn’t any more hip than the dated old layout, but for her felt significantly less like a graveyard, at least.\n\nBoth the already-negligent CEO and CFO had officially vanished with the last scraps of the budget AOL had been throwing the company quarterly, deleting their LinkedIns, locking their other social accounts, and dropping off Tharp’s immediate radar, which was – including what they’d legally stolen – so inconsequential that she’d delegated away their severance because she couldn’t be bothered to retain any memories of their existence. In less than a week, she had become MapQuest’s senior executive *and *completely redesigned its working environment. She had commandeered Peter’s corner office and expanded it dramatically so that every employee and guest would be immediately greeted by her steady, deep blue eyes above the immense span of her black desk, full-on upon entering the work floor and know immediately who it belonged to.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nFor the first time since the Zuckerberg scandal (as far as he could remember,) Lenny Lather arose, sober, before 10 on Monday morning to an empty *Nice, Big* in complete clarity. Refraining even from the French press, he departed the great house in sneakers and khaki shorts only two minutes after rising, bound for the corner diner a mile and a half down the road toward town. As he walked through the chaff on the sidewalk from yesterday’s first mass-mowing of the year, he meticulously turned over each of the major events and decisions in his recent past which had led him to destitution, living off of a young billionaire – financially and energetically – in the middle of Wisconsin, rapidly approaching fifty and his honest-to-goodness *last* last chance to redeem his career on the promise of a good story which his subject made sure he was always too high to write. And this was the *second consecutive *variation on this most unlikely of themes: young billionaires ruining his career.\n\nAt the diner, he gulped down eggs, toast, and four glasses of water before setting off over the same sidewalk upon which he came. *All it would take *for him to actually get the story on Theodore Pith – the young man who’d treated him like a stray dog with amusing habits – was the slightest bit of moderation, and he’d have a first-person account in the most intimate detail of how this reckless, absurdist young mogul lived, and he couldn’t possibly be more primed for public distaste – much less for accountability to the law. As he walked past the driveway upon which a round retiree was waxing his cabin cruiser for the new season, Lenny Lather committed to becoming relevant and respected again and made no motion to return the boatist’s friendly wave. Now, he had absolutely nothing to lose, and no excuse for hesitation or journalistic piety. Upon his arrival back at the house, he ignited a hot mid-day inferno in the study’s vast fireplace and methodically fed every single jumbled page of his notes from the past year to the flames. When it was all finished and burning, he sat erect in the red leather armchair with the thick curtains drawn over the tall windows in only the light from the blaze. Still in his sneakers and pouring sweat down his legs, he looked deep into the heart of the roar with a Parker between his fingers and a blank steno on his knee.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\nTheodore Pith arrived at the Baker St. office swooping in an all-black suit a few minutes after twelve o’clock, as the 20 employees of the new MapQuest who’d mustered the courage to show up on its first day had only then paused their work to partake timidly in the five-star catered Greek lunch which Lily Tharp had insisted upon in the common area. Only Madge Teeth had thought to bring her new laptop to the bar, on which she ruthlessly pounded out email after email into its very clicky new keys as she munched on quiche. Most of those brave enough to have remained worked in Customer Support, and were therefore most accustomed to static workstations, but upon their arrival throughout the morning – it took many varying amounts of self-soothing to must the courage to return to the office so soon – new desktop machines awaited each on (or in) their assigned spaces, along with new full-sized laptops, still in box. Two of the rigs still needed to be properly set up, and the boss had been expected at lunchtime, so the crowd was understandably antsy and they chewed like starving mules as he and his top-combed bobbing blood curl strut into view, quickly slowing at their obvious fright.\n\n“Now what is *wrong*, bunch?”\n\nHe spread his legs wide, rested his hands on his hips and pivoted slowly to look in every downturned face from his own frown before abruptly sliding the two strides to the office’s new big-door stainless steel fridge and produced from the pocket of its yet-to-be-cooling door, a seven-eighths-full bottle of Macallan 18, which he *plunked* down on the wood short-bar, raising his eyebrows.\n\n“Every one of you is going to take a swig of this, right now,” he ordered, looking between them again.\n\n“Uh, I don’t drink, and it’s like one PM on a Monday,” Madge said, returning her attention to her computer.\n\nA few murmured chuckles played through the largely stool-sat crowd.\n\n“Fine – you’re the only one that doesn’t need it but I’m not kidding… Everybody needs to come up here right now and take at least a single drink of this… I can see it in your faces.”\n\n…\n\n“Look, I’m sorry… I know this is the worst possible way to meet your new boss, but there are rare moments in life when all etiquette may be forgone in the face of evident truth, and the truth is…. Evidently, all of you need a goddamned drink!”\n\nReal grins and more voluminous *har har*s, now. Shad Balch – MapQuest’s last remaining web developer and the only of the crowd Pith yet knows by name – dismounts his stool and tugs the front of his sweater down, shaking his head lazily, chuckling as he arrives across the bar and is handed the whole bottle, dipping his arm and widening his eyes for a moment.\n\n“Jez,” he said, tipping the whole crowd – including Madge, even – into full-on, red-faced, pneumatic hammer-like cackling. Finally, others slowly move to line up behind Shad, who’s timidly raising the bottle’s attitude, sniffing and face-scrunching, but still giggling enough that his unsteadiness unfold’s Pith’s arms to the ready out of instinct as he cringes in view of the pitiful spectacle before him. He’s just inhaling to complain when Shad finally goes for two moderate gulps, his entire upper face theatrically squeezed shut with his eyes even still when he drops it and exhales twice as loud as was necessary and sets the bottle hastily down in front of Pith to scurry off like a 7-year-old who’s just been made to take his cough medicine.\n\n“Oh come on! That’s the best stuff there is!”\n\nPith rather firmly explains that the communion method is the most efficient for a moderately sized group like theirs to ingest alcohol from a single bottle when the support tech fourth in line twice insists that they “should just pass it around,” actually blurting out “you’re fired” but catching it quick to laugh it off as a tease.\n\n“She’s pregnant and I’m her attorney so square up, bitch,” barked Lily upon her arrival from her office, abruptly silencing the bits of chatter that had sprouted up in the line and moving all eyes to follow her as she nonchalantly bent down to grab a vine of purple grapes out of the loose grocery bag under the bar.\n\n“You wanna check in now, T?” she asked, rinsing them off.(fn)\n\n“Absolutely,” said Theodore, setting the scotch down gingerly on the touchpad of Madge’s laptop.\n\n“No exceptions – even pregnancy,” he said.\n\nTheodore shut Lily’s office door behind him so they could allow themselves a single, consolidated laugh. He clasped his hands behind his back and faced the framed, skillfully blown-up *Dixie Chicks *poster she’d already managed to have hung in the dead center of the new black paint on the far wall from her desk. She sat and wrestled for a moment with the computer display before freeing its base from an oversized brass hinge buried in the black wood desk. Pith began swaying side-to-side on his hips ever so slightly, still admiring.\n\n“Shad Balch,” he said.\n\n…\n\n“Shaaad *Balch,*” she replied.\n\n“Shadbalch… *BALCH*.”\n\nBreaking the spell upon him by the Goddesses on the dark wall, he turned to find the loveseat in the corner was the only seating yet to arrive, so he sat on its armrest, crossing his arms and legs.\n\n“So the post,” began Lily, appearing as if tiny, peeping at him from behind her huge desk, a dozen and a half feet away.(fn)\n\n“… It’s just all blatant lies.”\n\n“Well not *all *of it.”\n\n“Well, yeah.”\n\n…\n\n“Not even *most* of it, actually. Something like half.”\n\n“Half.”\n\n…\n\n“Oh, you are aware that absolutely *no one *reads those, right? Except journalists, really, and we’re not doing anything the tech magazines want to hear about, trust me.”\n\n…\n\n“It looks like shit just there on its own.”\n\n“Yeah, well, there’s not going to be anybody around to build any cushions physical *or* digital in the next 20 minutes, so we may as well just call it a fucking devblog for now.”\n\n“A devblog.”\n\n…\n\n“Yeah, which should also keep anyone and everyone away but the most tedious, maniacal journalist.”\n\n“What about art and design?”\n\n“Well… Even *Shad Balch* is sufficient for a *devblog*, but you should never, ever worry about visuals until the very last moment, these days. There are a billion starving, extremely talented young web and graphic designers within inches of you at any time. When we close further in on that point, we’ll toss a worm out over the lake and everything will be bid down by the competition and whipped up in no time at all to a quality beyond expectation – even delivered and backed up before it even hits the water.”\n\n“Sounds good to me.”\n\n“Just make sure to pay them way too much, okay? You could probably multiply their fee by 10 and it wouldn’t add up to a quarter of what we’d end up paying a designhouse to do it.”\n\n“Alrighty.”\n\n…\n\nPith leaned back and let his torso fall across the loveseat’s other armrest – head up, feet dangling.\n\n“Speaking of design… you fucking nailed the look of this place.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nAfter a moment of silence between the two, they felt something dense scrape into metal somewhere below them in the building without warning – Lily could feel a sickening crunch from the floor with her feet, and Theodore noticed the office door shake. They looked at each other and then over the other’s shoulder, each fairly certain they’d correctly identified the sound they’d heard moving away from- and then back toward them, heavily muffled from somewhere outside was that of a tortured compact car’s engine held to its rev limiter. Pith was struggling preposterously to escape the loveseat by violently rocking back and forth in order to build up enough perpetual momentum to propel his heavy end over the armrest when the dreadful noise began approaching again – though *much* more alarmingly rapid than before. Lily hustled out of the office containing her struggling boss and found a street-facing window just in time to see a flash of dusty metallic maroon disappear into ground level of the building, two floors beneath her as she felt and heard the impact – an almost cartoonish squeak at a deafening volume – before the building’s unsettling reeling.\n\nShe closed her eyes and waiting in the settling dust to hear screaming, but then recalled the last business to leave that lot – a restaurant called “Chicken Cunts” – had finished clearing out the previous Tuesday, and so was able to find able again to take slow, deep breaths freely. A total of only four other Questers were curious enough to make their way to the window by the time she opened them again, spinning back toward her office for her phone while acknowledging and reassuring their grim murmured expletives. Theodore Pith emerged from the doorframe as she approached.\n\n“*Whuh*oh. What was it?”\n\n“I think it was a car but I’m going to call. There’s nothing down there right now, so I’m sure it’s fine.”\n\n“Sure. I’m gonna pop down ‘n have a look.”\n\nNodding, they parted, Pith headed for the same window quizzingly, noticing the weary eyes turned his way, seeking an answer.\n\n“I’m sure everything’s fine, guys. I’ll be right back,” he shouted, extending his fingers back at them and once waving them vertically downward as he made his expediate way toward the lobby. He rounded the new, clinical stainless steel desk at reception through the door and the two dormant elevators outside for the stairwell without hearing anything one would generally expect shortly after their building has just been forcibly assaulted by an entire automobile. Double-down the steps he went through the drafty air of the well and its everpresent chlorine-scented breezes which opened him to the secondary hall – empty, still lit, alarms silent, and appearing not at all out of sorts. Over the navy blue carpet, swiveling his head between both the dark doorways of the maintenance and electrical rooms, around an L-joint, where he began to see indicators of destruction behind the *CHICKEN CUNTS* stickered logo on the plate-glass door at the end: chunks of plaster and a thin green stream slithering down the white tile.\n\nThrough the door – which was supposed to be locked by building policy – he saw that the event had been no cataclysm, really – a little red car had simply broken part-way through the West wall, failing even to compromise it enough to bring the section down completely, so it was snugly surrounded by the hole it punched, back wheels remaining in the Great Outdoors against the foundation’s edge. The vehicle, however, was a loss, no doubt – its nose badly grizzled, frothily steaming and ticking. Pith stepped through the crunching debris to better search the far driver’s side and was sharply startled by the gigantic hairy brown spider sitting on the roof – sufficiently to hoot and whoop to himself. He noticed the aggravated artistry across the distressed flank and an oblong creature in the left seat, contorted in a position his eyes had extreme difficulty comprehending, despite having a long moment to process the sight as Pith squinted and tilted his head.\n\n“Hey scrub!” he shouted, to no observable response.\n\n…\n\nHe crunched forward one step and pounded with his fist on the window between himself and the filthy bulges of the creature, yet it remained unstirring. He reached for the door’s black composite handle and lifted it gingerly, releasing the door in a *pop* as it released the pile of post-apocalyptic maritime recreation to roll clumsily onto the floor, where Theodore recognized it as former MapQuest COO Peter Built after a moment.\n\n“Heya! Mr. Built!”\n\nPeter half opened his eyes at the ceiling and exhaled a groan, awkwardly shifting his cruddy hands to his forehead.\n\n“Jesus man…” Pith chuckled, leaning against the wreck and glancing nervously at the unbothered Bo resting atop it.\n\nPeter Built continued his inverbal expressions of discomfort and blinked repeatedly, rolling a few inches right and left, but abruptly halted to inhale sharply and shoot his puffy, reddened eyes at Pith’s with great mania.\n\n“*HA*!” he screamed, contact unwavering.\n\n“Are you okay..? Peter?”\n\n…\n\n“PHEWah!” Built roared, at once leaping up and into a squeaky sprint for the former Chicken Cunts rear exit from which Theodore had come, who stood, following the sight as he burst through its glass, stumbled, cackling to one knee, yet continued his apparently unphased forward momentum until he was gone. He looked to the spider and then back again, wondering amusedly aloud under his breath until the big bug caught his instinctive attention when he started to wander about, zigzagging as he tacked down the far slope of the roof and around a building puddle of lime green antifreeze in pursuit of his companion.\n\nLily Tharp had finally convinced the building manager on her fifth try that she was *not* a robocaller,(fn) but in fact the top executive in charge of building matters at the Baker St. lot’s largest remaining tenant by far after he’d picked up four consecutive calls only to scream “*ROBOCALL ILLEGAL! ROBOCALL ILLEGAL*!” repeatedly, presumably with his phone’s receiver at the farthest possible distance from his ear until the other party (whom we know to be Ms. Tharp) would disconnect the call. Only by preparing herself for the fifth so that she bested his volume with her own rapidly repeated bellowing of “*STOP IT! HEY! STOP.*” had she finally persuaded him to listen enough to hear her identify herself moments before she glimpsed a blurred black tube shooting by the doorway from her periphery and heard rapid oscillating *pats* on the new carpet.\n\n“Yes, this is Lily from MapQuest at 1555 Baker St.-”\n\n“Uh huh.”\n\n“Yeah! I was calling about something serious you should prob-”\n\n“Okay, okay… You *need* to tell me… *exactly… what’s… happening*, okay?”\n\n“Ye-”\n\n“…*exactly*.”\n\nLily got on her feet to peer out her doorway both ways, still holding the phone to her ear.\n\n“I understand. I will try… to be as precise as I can, okay?”\n\nShe saw no tube, but did notice Maggie at the bar across the way was looking the direction of the restroom hallway, failing to stifle her giggling with her right wrist to her upper lip.\n\n“Going on fifteen minutes ago now, a car-”\n\n“Okay that’s great! Because you know people call me *angry *with all these *problems* like ‘a pipe burst,’ or ‘the shower is overflowing and I think the sink’s clogged, but you know I just divorced my husband of eight years and shaved the fuckin’ thing for the first time since,’ or ‘*help me help mee*, my cat’s in the microwave and I just set it to cook for *two hours*,’ and always with this *anger *in their *voices *like I have time for that! Like I wanna hear *you*, complaining about ya stupid life in the middle of the goddamn day! Like I don’t have nothin’ betta to do!”\n\nMaggie made the mistake of glancing over and locking eyes with Lily, who firmly asked her with the extreme altitude to which she raised her eyebrows to take immediate care of whatever the hell *that* was.\n\n“It’s just that *a car* has driven into our building!”\n\n“Oh my god! What? A *car*?”\n\n“Yes, a few minutes ago, I saw a car drive through the wall where Chicken Sluts was.”\n\n…\n\n“*Into *the side of the building, oh my god!”\n\nMaggie was on the move on the tube’s trail, head unnaturally forward, leading the way to the back, her arms unnaturally still as she plodded with a black earbud cable bouncing on her neck. Lily leaned out the opening to watch her round the corner before Theodore Pith startled her from behind with his muffled chuckle as he tried to nudge past, but realized the transgression and mouthed *sorry*, clicking his tongue and making his way back to the loveseat. Lily decided the best course of action in the face of her rambling phone contact was to leave the phone on speaker with him so that she could investigate herself.\n\n“He knows who we are… try and tell him what’s going on if he ever stops talkin, or just hang up. It probably doesn’t matter.”\n\nShe looked at him and pointed at the handset as she switched it over, placed it down on the desk, back-first, and whirled out of the office once more, nose in the air.\n\n“Oh my god… How stupid can you be?! Where do all these idiots come from? You drive your car through an *office building*?! In the middle of the damned city? Who the *hell* taught them anything? I swear to god… I just don’t know what to say sometimes, you know. I don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to do… And all these angry people call me and all they really want is somebody to yell at, but it’s my job, you know. I’ve gotta answer the phone and listen to all these every day – can’t understand them half the time – gotta listen to all these maniacs scream about lead in the pipes or asbestos in the walls because their allergies get bad when it’s *they themselves* who go out every Sunday to pick up *another* dusty-ass wardrobe off the curb so they can blog about *refurbishing *an *antique*, and by that they mean covering it in some $50 bright peppermint paint from Lowe’s they find out later doesn’t *dry* on wood, so all they’ve done is make a piece-a-trash old wardrobe so ugly and *visibly *sticky to the touch that it never even breaks a $40 bid on eBay, so they sell it to their Mom when she comes up for Easter, who’ll end up dumping it on *her *curb before Jesus is risen even one more time, and the whole damned cycle of wasted money will repeat again some other mother’s daughter arrives on a Sunday to bring it home in her Volvo who’s allergies it will *also* exacerbate, and *guess who* they’re gonna call to threaten with legal action?”\n\n…\n\nPith recognized the pause and hurriedly inhaled to reply, but was a moment too late.\n\n“I-”\n\n“I just don’t know about this. I’m so damned tired of it all… but ya know somebody’s gotta do it and it must be way worse out on the coasts…”\n\n## Chapter V\nIn the definitively matriarchal, mostly Germanic travel hub of Limon, Colorado, Barney, Barry, and Betty-Anne Blimp had begun the 1990s in a position to thrive. Barry, a Vietnam veteran with a chipped canine, an inherited family hog farm, and “crazy eyes” was headed down a new life avenue at forty-two in partial convenience store ownership with his best high school bud Tommy and a few of Tommy’s less-than-virtuous associates, which was – in such a prospective intersection of byways: the Kyle Railroad, Interstate 70, and proximity to the State’s two dominant metropolises – the *bee’s knees*. Marriage to his third wife, Betty-Anne had cemented his newfound potential satisfactorily enough to be granted a business loan from the lone regional banking chain the same week their first and only child was birthed, snipped, and dunked in Lutheran from-concentrate Holy Water.\n\nBarney’s mother was an embodiment of this Brisk American Process – never doing anything without haste; denouncing even in middleage the necessity (or existence) of *The Long Game*. Despite her pace, she had found in Librarianism a place of belonging on her first go – graduating from the University of Denver with a Masters in Library Science at just 19 after testing in before she could legally drive thanks to the diligence (and yes, the speed) of her homeschooling. If the Limon Memorial Library could even remotely afford a memorial statue, a towering Betty-Anne would surely grace its grounds now, brass-in-motion with her youthful black curls as near as feasibly perpendicular in a trail behind her form, as the institution owed its entire existence to her ruthless wit and otherworldly, naturally-amphetamined energy. If one took it upon themselves to speculate, they might suggest that it was indeed her speed that grayed, then bleached her curls white within a single year; that the circumstances surrounding Barney’s creation were from most planes of analysis quite tardy, and that Barry – while perhaps the most appropriately quick match she could’ve made – was a bad decision; that mothering a child after one’s hair has entirely silvered was uncouth and unnatural – much less after it had wholly *whitened*. One is free to indulge these speculations, but Betty-Anne never traveled in an even remotely slow enough velocity to hear or ponder or engage with them, right up to her Judgment Day before her Maker, in fact, whom she no doubt found aggravatingly dull.\n\nIt’s largely forgotten by those who’ve traversed the class divide in the 21st century that childhood in Barney’s era had changed little since that of his parents’ in diet: afternoon cartoons, ketchup, macaroni, hotdogs, and the lot – albeit a bit more processed. There were still Marvel superheroes, arcades, billion-piece, tediously-assembled model cars & aeros, and Little League. The difference – according to the retrospective ponderings of the architectural Boomers themselves – was in the way Merit & Achievement were processed. They say it was the cushion of encouragement and their own elimination of Loss – as factor, variable, and fact of the reality which they crafted for their kin – that fucked up entirely their children’s potential ability to climb above it. In Barney Blimp’s case, however, the fucking was certainly of more nuanced origin, as “losing” was defined differently, with an even greater weight in his mind than his parents’ generation could have possibly imagined.\n\nBarney never lost in track, baseball, football, or basketball because he never lowered himself to compete in such worldly things. He found most of his 200-odd graduating classmates lacking in luster, but in the blossoming neo-puritanical world of online gaming, Blimp had the pick of the globe, and from preadolescence onward he spent his time virtually among all manner of millennial punks learning how to challenge himself – in fact, learning *above all* to be competitive. The ideal gamer in the early days was a brotherly roughhouser who competed even in cooperation, regardless of their success, and the glorified *Shithead* persona sat well with the jaded group of five highschool friends who adopted and eventually socialized him.\n\nEast by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of the Rockies, the meat of Colorado is – as its nearest Easterly neighbor is so notoriously – *fucking flat*. In daylight, one's field of vision – one’s entire world – is constricted by the limitations of Earth's curvature, which dooms their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of Barney’s home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions. Over years and decades of existing in such a small place throughout such a formative time, human beings like Blimp and his peers live with a profoundly specific spatial psyche, boundaried absolutely. In a town like Limon, it can be tempting – for a visitor – to sift through the longtime occupants according to how they choose (or – depending on one’s choice position within the nature/nurture argument – are *predisposed*) to respond to these boundaries. It is not unreasonable to say – timidly, anyway – that *most* find comfort within them, and – much less timidly – to say that they lead overwhelmingly more satisfied lives. Others – like Barney’s *Limon Six* – end up classically claustrophobic and tend to spend significant time and energy in their formation of abrasive relationships with both physical and psychological bounds. An integral compounding effect on this aspirational affliction could perhaps be attributed to their Boomer parents and their intermittent, vague insistences like *you can be anything you want*, *you can do anything you set your mind to*, and their infinite variations.\n\nThe Blimps traveled phenomenally often for a Limon family but never incurred the notion – as long as travel was within their wants and means – to leave North America. Nevertheless, young Barney’s primary preferences for any given road trip were simply for the exploration of altitude; by distant or traversed mountains – by far the most bewitching – and commercial flight, when it was afforded. Whether by backseat or Boeing, the perception of distance enabled by proximity to more diverse typography was nothing less than a treat and his own continent’s allotment seemed plenty. It was these higher experiences that provided him a penetrating catalyst of the sort of ethereal meditation comprehendible only by those who’ve yet to develop past a certain age; the sort which many seek in a plethora of desperations until they’re able to accept its loss. The edged flirtation of Earth with sky were the elemental constants he’d be forever doomed to seek. For the lucky Most, however, the altitudes are not so relentlessly haunting and the six-mile planet is rarely insufficient, but the curiouser of them are universally bound with the whole by their want for understanding that Other aspirational itch as the occupants of each pole are with one another, inevitably, regardless of how fervently they happen to reflect upon the decider.\n\nThe inevitable binding was also for the others of the *Six* – Leona, Leo, Liam, Lazarus, and Lexie – out of their collectively loosening grip on the special Magic in each, as many or most friendships are, and together they observed in themselves and one another the development of their internal compulsion to find a suitable replacement, and – when at their best – maintained an audit of its power. Most of the instances of need did not come when it felt feasible to fill them with literal wandering as they do not for all but those few with unlimited resources. Farming or service-funded families raise children who must smoke weed and/or drink cheap beer in bulk as their world darkens and squishes, and so *The Limon Six* of Limon Junior-Senior High School entered their stoner stage shortly after their original congregation, when Barney was fifteen and so wholeheartedly, insularly elitist that his preferred external self-projection was of generalized insanity – though of the least manageably interesting variety – in order to discourage any and all contact with as broad a portion of his peers as possible.\n\nThe fallibility of young Barney Blimp’s plan was his own innate desire for companionship, which 1) prevented the scheme from ever being *truly* wholehearted and 2) necessitated input from other perspectives, as the execution of any human intention will, thereby contradictorily arranging himself to fail. Lazarus, the Junior – the eldest of the lot – was predisposed to target Barney’s person at lunch hour as a thoroughly weird, but nevertheless compulsively social young man. It was only September when he one Wednesday sat down across from Blimp and immediately began discussing amateur radio operation and its untapped potential among American secret societies, unprompted.\n\n“So if the Masons are *not *a secret society,” he began, “why is it that they specifically developed secret methods of identifying one another in public and – really – what even *defines *a ‘secret society’ if not its investment in the development of secret methodologies for its participants’ intra-identification, anyway?”\n\nBarney stopped chewing with a mouthful of his daily one-dollar ham sandwich and bored his eyes into Lazarus’ resting thumbs. In response, they began vigorously twiddling straightaway.\n\n“Of course, they made sure to place their symbology everywhere, which I would imagine is probably pretty fun. I wonder if they just screen *National Treasure *on repeat for regular meetings, these days. I would for sure put in for that.”\n\nCheeks still bulging, Barney Blimp conceded to full, unabridged eye contact with the weariness of ten millennia.\n\n“Dude, I’m definitely going to become a Free Fucking Mason, but I’m going to modernize their whole shit. Ham radio, you know – probably the most equally-obscured community for the general populace, equally obsessed with ciphers, and *certainly *the only respective equals in socially anti-social activity for old white men with Asperger’s.”\n\nA Freshman eyebrow was raised; the Freshman chewing, resumed, and the genius of The Junior Lazarus thought it would have a go at a bit of baity ignorance.\n\n“I mean, if we all really wanted walkie talkies for our treehouse clubs in Elementary school, then it would only make sense to launch the Masons onto the UHF band, right?”\n\n“VHF,” said Barney through two-day-old pork and peeled-away cheddar. “UHF is for TVs, radar, and cellular phones; *vee h eff* is ham radio.”\n\nLazarus bowed his head, smiled, and faced forward his palms, and thus – in the chemically vomit-scented lunchroom of Limon Junior-Senior High School – the socialization of Barney Blimp began with a bid to modernize the American Freemasons which – if pursued – would’ve proved to be in vain, for by then, in 2003, almost all of the membership had Hotmail accounts. Liam Libel – a Freshman that year, like Barney and by a wide berth the dirtiest of the *Six* – did not, but he *did *proudly maintain a subscription to *Reason *Magazine and communicated exclusively in savagely relentless Libertarian shouts. After his particularly-troubled World History teacher developed a gasoline drinking habit and fell tremendously ill over Winter break, Liam’s class was absorbed into Blimp’s, which was not much trouble logistically for such a moderately-sized student body, but *was* from day 1 significant trouble for Barney and his surrounding peers.\n\nThe new, consolidated 10:33AM World History block totaled thirty-three students, who were doing their best to *physically* and *spatially* consolidate as the last remaining teacher of World History employed at Limon Junior-Senior High School introduced himself.\n\n“Hello hello hello, welcome welcome,” cooed the diminutive man in that manner which only secondary educators do.\n\n“New folks, I’m Mr. Drake – hello hello hello and *wel*come back… Yes, sorry about the space… It looks like everybody’s doing a great job… Good job managing… This is only for a few weeks, don’t worry… Yes, please do your best to settle in… Yes, hello hello hello, you’re in the right place! Welcome welcome welcome *back*… I’m Mr. Drake.\n\n“Before we get started with the curriculum for this semester… It won’t be all that different from what it would’ve been if… And I promise you it won’t be further complicated if and when we move to new rooms, of course, so don’t worry about that… I just wanted to talk about a few policies specific to *my* class for the new folks… A brush up for the rest of you, of course, he he…”\n\nMr. Drake hobbled all around his desk, the projector, then to the door, which he unpropped with his right moccasin and began to close but reconsidered with an audible *hm* and shuffled awkwardly to open and prop again with a kick of his *left* moccasin, mumming *hm* again, hobbling his way to the thermostat, which he dramatically leaned back, then forwards, then back again to examine, adjusting his glasses and wedging his right hand flat against his kidney to form a tea kettle handle. He looked that way at it for a few seconds before he attempted to begin another thought, aloud.\n\n“*Aaaaaand* we’re just going ta… mmhmm, so it looks like… It looks like… I’m going to keep this turned down just so ah… We’re going to keep the thermostat turned down for now… I think there are enough of us to keep it quite warm in here… Of co-… Ah… Of course, if anybody starts to get especially chilly… Chilly, just let me know.”\n\n“So!” he said, turning to the squirming, now mildly claustrophobic class for the first time, folding his glasses again.\n\n“I want to begin by talking about the *future* a little bit, if that’s okay with everybody… Our terrible future! In which we will all be *ruled* by these little things!” He produced a scuffed silver flipphone from the black leather holster on his belt.\n\n“Even now, the common man is surrounded by so many things he just cannot understand. His cellular telephone, his car, his home computer… It's hard not to wonder what exactly goes through mom and dad’s minds when they see them operate, huh? It must be reduced down to… Almost superstition, you know? Nothing Voodoo, mind you, but – in some way, deep in the mind of the average schmuck, his cellular telephone is quickly becoming his god.”\n\nMr. Drake returned the phone to its holster and looked behind him to retreat enough to sit on his rough, pockmarked, and splintery cherrywood desk as Mr. Libel himself huffed through the door with a pronounced, angsty furrow in his brow, his right arm holding the sling of his ratty tote over the right shoulder of his even rattier creamy brown leather jacket. Even faced with the density of desks and flustered teens, he did not pause even though one would assume it was surely necessary.\n\n“Hello hello hello… Welcome, welcome,” said Mr. Drake more quickly, his head tracking Liam’s ungainly slotting upon a free, deskless chair against the farthest wall between twin spectacled boys with matching curly blonde afros, just behind Barney, followed by the careless thudding of his bag on the foot-worn carpet in front.\n\n“Right!” continued Mr. Drake from his perch. “And for you, it will become a god also, but one of a different sort… Many Godly persons desire their particular deity to do the work; to only interact with what’s on the surface, but you! You hold our newfound technological god as one to be known! And that is exactly how it should be… Not just for the sake of the knowledge, itself, but for the betterment of our lives… Now…”\n\nHe placed both palms on his desk and leaned forward.\n\n“Before we again begin with our *history*, I want to tell you something very important… There’s a war on. And… You wanna know a secret?”\n\nSpeaking in a more whispery projection, he leaned his bald patch forward a bit more.\n\n“There’s a war on… There’s a war on you!” He thrusted his pointer finger at the class – who maintained a collective stoicism – as he hopped again to his feet and began pacing, hands together behind him.\n\n“It’s on everyone who thinks… Everyone young who learns! It’s on everyone with progress on their minds… It’s a war waged even on knowledge, itself… A war of ignorance.”\n\nMr. Drake paused, swiveling his gaze on his heels, gray eyes wide. In the rear, Liam scoffed loudly over the disinterested silence, slouched all the way back in his rigid chair and hoisting his legs to cross them on Barney’s left shoulder.\n\n“Ay, YO TEECH,” he yelled in Mr. Drake’s general direction, glancing left and right. “YO TEECH, you blaze tron?”\n\nMr. Drake, frozen in the forward stoop he’d been glaring from, offered no reply. Barney brushed briskly at Liam’s Converses against his head as if they were a lost lunar moth.\n\n“Yo teech, you just tell me if you want a little somun somun, you know what I mean,” Liam said, *Ha Ha*ing with his right hand eclipsed over his smile.\n\n“Dude,” Barney complained. Libel sat up again and returned his feet to the floor, but didn’t otherwise acknowledge the protest. He threw his right arm into an arc over his head and made his hand into a vague pistol shape, pointed at Mr. Drake.\n\n“Ay, YO TEECH… BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVENA RON PAUL… Ha ha! YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY… THIS COUNTRY GOIN TO SHIT, *MAN*.”\n\nMr. Drake self-consciously returned to standing upright, but his eyes looked miles beyond the far wall and his students – thirty-one of whom had yet to react at all.\n\n“Why is it ALWAYS BOXES, *man*? What’s with the FUCKIN BOXES? YO TEECH, THIS SOME BULLSHIT.”\n\nBarney set about gathering his things to escape the tirade, but Liam had begun to violently writhe about in his chair and appeared to be quickly descending into a fit, which exponentially slowed Blimp’s organization.\n\n“DON’T DO THIS, TEECH. DON’T LABEL ME!”\n\nHis whole body was convulsing now and his magazines were bounding and bouncing toward serious altitudes on top of him like wheat chaff as it’s shaken free of the grain.\n\n\"AY YO TEECH… WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THESE CAGES ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK.\"\n\nAnd with that, his chair failed him as he shook to the ground on his hands and knees – still hollering in bodily tumult.\n\n\"COME ONNNN*NNNN* TEECH, YOU KNOW I CAN’T FIT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT BOX,” he spat at the rug.\n\nNeither Mr. Drake nor his pupils had moved or expressed anything, save for Barney Blimp, who stepped over Liam Libel with his backpack and threaded his way strenuously through the desks and static legs, feet, and empty faces through the door. A hundred yards down the hallway, as he leaned against the exit, a final croaking throw came from behind him.\n\n“*Ron Pal!*”\n\nThe creaking of the exit door – hinges wanting for a greasing – and the *swooshing* of its bottom seal against the muddy black shoemat yielded not for Barney Blimp the fresh Colorado air and lucid sunshine, but instead – through a haze of drug-numbed internal retching and destruction – the stagnantly sterile, ammonia’d atmosphere and lifeless colors of a meager hospital room. From the open hallway to his left came an ambiently echoing broadcast of unexpected contextual quality.\n\n“Welcome, Frances Fujica Chamberlain, eleven pounds, six ounces,” said a theatrically raspy woman’s voice, followed by a pleasantly rhythmic rock sample.\n\n“*BLINDed by the light */ *revved up like a deuce */ *another roller in the night!*”\n\nYet, it was the tiny wall-mounted television that captured Barney’s newly-awoken, moderately-medicated attention. From diagonally across his tall bed with its faded floral sheets and itchy medium blue comforter, the minuscule CRT blared a top-of-the-hour *Good Morning America *graphic.\n\n“Good morning, America. Breaking news, the FBI takes on Apple demanding the tech giant help with a terror investigation. Are critical clues to more plots hidden on the phone of the San Bernardino shooters? Why Apple's CEO is refusing to help this morning. A battle that could affect everyone with a smartphone,” said the voice of the aging anchor from under a dyed black combover to whom the introduction transitioned along with a lower third graphic that said “JAKE JINGLES, ABC NEWS.” \n\n*Apparently, it is the morning*, thought Barney Blimp.\n\n“Good morning,” he whispered. Jake Jingles and his co-host Jaime Jangles then went on about the idiosyncrasies of the G.O.P., quoted and played back a clip of the current President saying *I believe so and so will never be President*, then a shorter clip of “BJ, a German Shorthaired Pointer” – clearly somewhere else in the studio, sitting obediently, cocking his head at the approaching camera lens – before finally returning to a wide-shot of Jingles and Jangles sitting abreast, smiling off screen at the dog.\n\n“All right, and good morning, America. There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club's Best in Show Award. He's just arriving here in Times Square. He took a walk there on our green carpet in case you missed it. We cannot wait to meet the top dog coming up. Hear what he has to say about his win. The biggest bone of all.”\n\n“A great-looking dog.”\n\n“He walks like a winner.”\n\n“He is.”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“Amazing,” said Barney Blimp, all at once noticing how uncomfortable his entire physical being had been left in its current, awfully-upright position against a mountain of pillows that looked promising, but disappointingly lacked fulfilling qualities one tends to hope for and enjoy in promising-looking pillows. He lifted his rear to scoot it down and felt an unsettling tremor of his out of kilter equilibrium atop faint whole-body pins and needles from – no doubt – remaining more or less stationary for hours?...days?\n\n“…have more on that later. But right now lots of reaction coming in overnight to that emotional appearance in the White House briefing room from Chief of Staff Eggs White. The former general raw and red-eyed as he defended the President, attacked his critics, and remembered the death of his own son on the battlefield. Chief White House correspondent Geoffrey Gouge starts us off. Good morning, Geoff…”\n\nRealizing the excess of the television’s current volume was insistently coercing the entirety of his attention, Barney looked about him – despite the dizziness – searching for the remote control. To his left, there was only empty space and the burst of brief, sickly draft from a cycle of the neighboring Intensive Care Unit airlock; to his right, a substantially loaded IV pole holding both black and translucent liquid bags, and a hang-over eating tray on castors which was – quite strangely – surfaced in a bright, neon-green neoprene, and contained a small-book-sized touch tablet. He reached for it, tapping the black screen with his right index finger’s plastic heart-rate monitor in an attempt to illicit life. After a few clumsy tries, he achieved a sort of success: an awkward, large-print menu faded into view with five haphazardly off-center options next to hopelessly-scaled stock graphics: *DRUGS*, *MEDIA*, *BILLING*, *SCHEDULING*, and *SUPPORT*. Barney tried *MEDIA*, but the subsequently displayed controls were muted somehow – left transparent. No amount of tapping yielded any change in the program, which had turned to a montage of B-roll: red-faced parents talking on mobile phones on the black asphalt – crowded to the point of insanity by neutral-colored SUVs outside a sprawling red brick building sprouting the tiniest trickle of gray smoke from the far wing.\n\n“The driver, look at this, pulled over after he smelled smoke, and that's when flames erupted. More than a dozen students from the Jacksonville area high school had to evacuate. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The children were picked up by a different bus and taken home. No word on what caused this in the first place, but certainly glad everyone is okay this morning, Jake.”\n\n“Thank goodness for that. And now to that big win overnight for the Los Angeles Dodgers, heading to their first World Series since 1988,” continued Jake Jingles as the slightest electronic pseudodance percussion was subtly faded behind his voice in the background – its 140 beat-per-minute high hats abnormally flattered by the bias of the pitiful speakers within the wall-mounted unit, furthering Blimp’s aggravation with the situation. He amplified his aggression toward the tablet, holding it just inches from his nose as he pounded his fingers on the glass. The original menu came briefly back into view before the *DRUGS* option was selected, swapping the theme entirely for microscopic, illegible text and alarmingly primary reds. The unassuming white plastic pump suspended in the middle of his IV pole suddenly clicked and began a drawling, whirred chugging. Panicking at the sound and the new movements of fluids he perceived, Barney vigorously attacked the big red *X* in the top-right corner with every ounce of available effort left in the stumps of his thumbs, and was – to his gracious relief – rewarded with the cessation of the horrors.\n\n“…guy behind looked so concerned until the last second. Also right now a lot of reaction coming to that emotional moment in the White House press briefing room. Chief of Staff General White, defending the President's calls to the families of fallen soldiers. Also took on the President's critics and opened up about the loss of his own son on the battlefield…”\n\nBarney Blimp sighed in extreme exasperation and threw the tablet down on the tray, sinking under the sheets until his feet felt the footboard and hung over it, both hands desperately gripping the comforter, pulling it over his nose so that only his eyes-up were exposed. A new wave of drowsiness gushed from his numb belly and washed over him like sleepy molasses, tinging his vision light blue as he tilted it with his head on the flat bed below the pillow mountain to focus on a single one of the ceiling tile’s dark red polka-dots. *Spackled blood*, he thought – the removed Observer of his consciousness noting how much less anxious he was in the moment than he should’ve rationally been, while knowing, of course, that his state was entirely the result of whatever drugs they had him on.\n\n“Welcome, Leslie Désirée Lund, eight pounds four ounces… *BLINDed by the light*…”\n\nBarney Blimp’s eyes drooped heavy as his Observer ceased short its attempt to recollect the sequence of events which led him there – wherever *there* was – it was a bed… a less-than-moderately comfortable bed… and instead considered the definition of “roller” in “*another roller in the night*.” Not *roller* as in “high *roller*,” no. Not “*roller* blades,” though it… he… *they* had always wanted to learn how to inline skate… *Aggressive* inlines. Speed skating was such an elegant, lost art. Why weren’t there more speed skaters swooping and sliding around, bent over with their hands behind their backs to cut through the air oh-so-beautifully… in all State and National parks… in cardigans… and purple sweatbands? *What happened to them all?*\n\n“…and after the break, Jaime and I sit down with Theodore Pith, the young artificial intelligence pioneer and mogul, now author of a new book about cheese and the end of the world…”\n\nR-o-l-l-e-r, *roller*. A flour-dusted light wood cylinder with matching old style handles, loose… Loose, but that’s how they were supposed to be… how they had to be or else it would not roll separately of them… Except it was *huge*, and growing! Gargantuan! And the hands! Covered in dark black hairs of a simply *vulgar *length and nearly as big… Bringing the overwhelming girth of the surface – the *much *too *solid* and *threatening* surface – to flatten his body! Rhythmically rolling and squishing and flattening Barney Blimp and his organs against this awful, foreign bed like *fucking dough! *He was more conscious now, but still unable to move – completely paralyzed… And the hellish utensil was on its way back again! *Revved up like a deuce…* *The toes*, he remembered! He and his Observer concentrated everything they had on wiggling their toes… *really* wiggling… and finally… they wiggled alive!\n\nLiberated from his dream and waking paralysis, Barney shot up – sheets, comforter, tubes, cables, and all – inhaling massively only to see on the tiny wall television the pale, smiling face, flashing green eyes, and blood-red hair of his new boss sitting cross-legged in a purple chair astride the *GMA* watermark as the show returned from a commercial break. Opposite a table packed with granite-looking half-pipes full of steaming brown beans were the smooth faces of Jake Jingles and Jaime Jangles.\n\n“Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of the new, quite controversial but hot-selling book – especially here in New York, *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything*,” said Jake Jingles with occasion.\n\n*Fuck*, mouthed Barney Blimp.\n\n“…and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan barbecue joints, Pith's Chili Trough and Pith's Chili Playpen. We've got what looks to be a... Ha ha, well... a miniature *trough* of chili right here in front of us. Wow! A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith... Your book seems well… It seems to be in direct opposition to what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?”\n\n“SON OF A *FUCKING BITCH!” *screamed Barney, hoarsely. His hands moved to fumble with the tablet again, mouth agape as Jake Jingles fumbled similarly in propping an obnoxiously-covered volume upright for the camera, on screen, struggling to obscure an apparently-obscene illustration of a nude woman covered in cheese – his right hand accomplishing the censorship of all but her cheese-strung feet behind the title text.\n\n“Yes, that's an understandable contrast to make, Jack,” Pith answered as the broadcast switched to his full-shot angle. He himself was deeply contrasted with the formal wear of everyone present – save for some of the studio audience, perhaps – with his pale, freckled arms sticking out of a plain white t-shirt which said on its front in a loud, large, simple sans-serif typeface *TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH.*\n\n“First, I'd like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared... Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don't be shy – get your hands dirty! It's Chili Day!”\n\nTheodore Pith waved wildly and dumbly, gyrating both palms at the present audience, off screen, who whooped and cheered in response. Their audience camera was clumsily cut to a bit later than it should’ve been. Jake Jingles forced a chuckle.\n\n“Well, there it is... You've got to love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?”\n\nJaime Jangles chimed in with an addendum, first two right fingers drumming on her chin.\n\n“And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?” She gestured toward his torso, emptily smiling.\n\n“First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there... I'm actually going to start digging in, if you don't mind,” Theodore Pith said, shoving the provided logo-adorned bib under his right thigh.\n\n“No, of course... I think I'll join right in with ya,” replied Jake, who sat forward and looked helplessly at the massive task before him.\n\n“I, myself, really don't find the book's argument in conflict with my love of- and affection for chili, particularly.” He threaded the provided (and also logo-adorned) garden trowel under a great yellow-brownish gop of beans and scooped it toward his maw, spilling a few ounces on the oversaturated rug. Jake Jingles was having one hell of a time shoving his own logo-adorned bib into the front of his shirt without rubbing his live lapel microphone unnecessarily.\n\n“That argument being – as I understand having read as much as I could last night – that our obsession with food is... Well, sort of rampant and infecting our culture-”\n\n“...and stealing attention from important efforts in humanitarian policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you *do* finish the book – and I really hope you do, George, really… – you’ll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it is by now our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome's time to fall, if you’re catching my drift.”\n\nBarney Blimp was now a reddening, rigid live wire – his fury crossing a threshold in his heart monitor, setting off its alarm in triads. *Beepbeepbeep*.\n\nJake Jingles – now equipped properly with logo-adorned bib – looked across the table in building agitation at Theodore Pith, twirling his clean trowel. From beside him, Jaime Jangles – yet to be misnamed, and thus slightly less huffy – offered her intermediation.\n\n“I have to say... I haven't gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my Me Food – I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his *even more*, and it's hurtful, the suggestion that my interest in good food is somehow wrong or dangerous-”\n\n“...oh, James! Don't look so bashful! Please, do eat your chili!”\n\nThere was a great, gaping, deadly live television pause filled with the swishing and swashing of the pale Pith’s rhythmic chewing over the 140 beat-per-minute electro beat, his otherwise quiet person in frame, t-shirt now covered in brown, eyes cast downward to the half-empty trough before him.\n\nJaime Jangles cleared her throat.\n\n“I’m Jaime, actually…”\n\nThe eyes came up with a full mouth, from which hung a six-inch-long string of cheese.\n\n“...oh shit, I'm so sorry! That's really embarrassing...”\n\nTheodore Pith looked to her, then to the camera and back. Behind the camera, the audience conveyed together both amused applause and inverbal admonishment.\n\n“Jaime, please let me make it up to you… have some of *my* chili!”\n\nJingles and Jangles cringed, smiled, and managed chuckles with all the restraint in the world.\n\n“Hey, now! There are families watching this live, Mr.- ”\n\n“…gosh, I am so sorry.”\n\nTheodore looked to the camera covered in chili as the shot cycled back to him.\n\n“Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-”\n\n“…let’s just try and get back to the book, alright?”\n\n“Sure, sure... It's really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.”\n\nThe triplets of the Barney Blimp alarm had finally summoned a disheveled young orderly, who bussed immediately around the dismal bed to cease it in a blur of dark purple and Chanel No. 5.\n\n“Good, good! It’s good to see you up… Barney-“\n\n“Please turn off the television,” he said.\n\n“… I’m sorry?”\n\n“TURN *OFF*… the television. Turn off the TV, please.”\n\nThe orderly looked up from the tablet on her forearm to the screen, where Jaime Jangles was hesitantly playing with her little shovel.\n\n“Wow, yes, I can't even visualize… How long did the process take, do you know?”\n\n“At least three... Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was,” to *wows* from Jangles, Jingles, and the audience.\n\n“For God’s sake, turn… it… *OFF!*”\n\n“That's actually... really no time at all,” said Jake.\n\n“Really quick,” nodded Jaime.\n\n“OFF!” screamed Barney Blimp, in a single, swift motion picking up the tablet and hurling it – inches from the nurse’s nose – to a perfectly placed impact on the little TV, cracking its screen and inducing a brief blip of white noise blinds, yet neither the horrid appliance nor his visitor flinched a bit. The later calmly returned her attention to her own tablet, then to the IV pole’s machinery.\n\n“Mr. Blimp, please try to control yourself.”\n\nJake Jingles again stiffly manipulated the bright-orange volume, turning it in profile and then over, very deliberately assuring that the cheesy woman be excluded from the shot.\n\n“It's nearly five-hundred pages, right? And this is your first book?”\n\n“First *published* book under my own name, you know. I've written a few other things, here and there, but that's a subject for another time.”\n\n*Aw*, said the audience.\n\n“Sure, we’ve got to have you back some time,” said Jake Jingles with visible grit in his smile.\n\n“Jesus,” said Barney Blimp.\n\n“But, this apocalypse... Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or...?”\n\n“All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world…”\n\n“Mother*fucker.*”\n\n“…in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit... And yet, we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.”\n\nUp went the young woman’s eyebrows as she tapped her tablet, unpainted fingernails clacking.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry about the TV, but could you *please* just turn it off for me?”\n\n“A striking thought,” said Jake Jingles.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she replied, making eye contact for the first time, eyebrows erect with no minimum of patronization. “I can’t do that, Barney, but I *can* have something to eat brought up for you, if you’d like.”\n\n“*…another roller in the night!*”\n\n“Quite. And that was the idea, but it's also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope – that Rome's decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?”\n\n“Well, I'm glad you brought this chili with you... It *is* quite an achievement,” said Jaime Jangles, having eaten half a trowel’s worth.\n\n“How does that sound, huh…? It’s Chili Day!”\n\nBarney Blimp gripped the handles straddling his bed-bound prison so ferociously that he soon blacked out.\n\n⌬⌬⌬\n\n*Dr. Gravel, it is with great haste and discretion that I write you regarding a patient who was received in the care of St. Nicholas’ ICU on Thursday afternoon (the 8th) – Barney Barry Blimp, age 30 – with a few requests in the interest of his particular and quite consequential needs on behalf of his very long-time friend and employer, Mr. Theodore Pith, who is deeply distraught and regrets that he is unable contact you personally at this time. He is, however, willing, wanting, and able to allocate any and all necessary resources to ensure the fulfillment of these needs, including a prospective donation to the Kare 4 Kids fund and/or support of other/equivalent programs at St. Nicholas. Please contact me directly as soon as you are able so that we may further the discussion (the numbers for both my cell and personal extension at the Institute can be found at the end of this message.) Until then, it would be to Mr. Pith’s tremendous satisfaction and appreciation if you were to promptly act in your best ability to ensure the alterations to Mr. Blimp’s stay as follows…*\n\n## Chapter VI\nIn the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.\n\nTheodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.\n\nIn the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.\n\nThe latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.\n\n“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.\n\n…\n\n“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.\n\n…\n\n“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.\n\n“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”\n\n…\n\nFinally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.\n\n“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nUnable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*\n\n…\n\n“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”\n\nLenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.\n\n“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.\n\nAs he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.\n\n“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.\n\n“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.\n\n“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”\n\n…\n\n“Right-o, as you say, sir!”\n\n…\n\n“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”\n\n…\n\n“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”\n\n…\n\n“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”\n\n…\n\nAfter the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.\n\n“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.\n\n“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.\n\n“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.\n\nAnd the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”\n\nThe Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.\n\n“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.\n\n“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.\n\nPerhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather.\n\n“Sir! Excuse me!”\n\n…\n\n“*Excuse me!* Sir!”\n\n…\n\nTheodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”\n\nKeys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”\n\n“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.\n\n“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.\n\n“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.\n\nAfter he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.\n\n“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.\n\n“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”\n\nThough the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.\n",

I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself <em>stuck</em> with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and (on DOS) <code>dir</code>. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells <em>on iOS</em>: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243\"><strong>iSH Shell</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438\"><strong>a-Shell</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png\" alt=\"iSH Shell and a-Shell\"></p>\n<p>The former is designed to emulate <a href=\"https://alpinelinux.org\">Alpine Linux</a> and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/\">SW-DLT</a> - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell\">a fork</a> of our subject app, now called “<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306\"><strong>Blink Shell &amp; Code</strong></a>” in the App Store.[^1]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png\" alt=\"bbj Out\"></p>\n<p>Blink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">landing page</a> touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On <em>iPad</em>, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps\">Paul Miller’s 2018 article for <em>The Verge</em></a> and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “<a href=\"https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/\">Using the iPad Pro as my development machine</a>.” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png\" alt=\"Apreche Reply\"></p>\n<p>Since I’ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739\">apparently</a> ended up with a primary life mission of <em>doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads</em>, I’ve managed to find myself <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone\">an active member</a> of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136\">public pages</a> - exclusively through <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/jorts\">my iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~apreche\">Apreche</a>’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my <em>fucking phone</em>, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way.</p>\n<p><em>It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png\" alt=\"Blink Settings\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"locally\">Locally</h2>\n<p>First, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing <code>config</code> and/or <code>⌘,</code>. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/fonts\">fonts</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes\">themes</a> - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js\">CLRS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js\">Man Page</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js\">MonaLisa</a>, but this Post is saturated with <em>too</em> many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png\" alt=\"Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage\"></p>\n<p>Compared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with <code>TAB</code>. Where a-Shell has <code>pickFolder</code>, Blink has <code>link-files</code>, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png\" alt=\"Repository Cleaning\"></p>\n<p>Linking <a href=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge\"><em>The Psalms</em>’ GitHub Repository</a> in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807\">Working Copy</a> with <code>link-files</code> in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. <code>open</code> also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png\" alt=\"BaityYouTubeThumbnail\"></p>\n<p>Some other particularly intriguing standouts include <code>say</code>, which unfortunately does <em>not</em> use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. <code>facecam</code> will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. <code>openurl</code> will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. <code>code</code> is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png\" alt=\"Blink and Code\"></p>\n<p>Blink’s own “<a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup\">UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup</a>” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what <code>skstore</code> does. <code>xcall</code> opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command\">still trying to figure out</a> what the command’s options are. <code>ed</code> the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and <code>uptime</code> appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run <code>whois</code> locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of <code>pbcopy</code>. <code>whois bilge.world | pbcopy</code> copies <em>The Psalms</em> domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png\" alt=\"Blink Keyboard Shortcuts\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"keyboarding\">Keyboarding</h3>\n<p>To its credit, I think <a href=\"https://blink.sh\">Blink’s landing page</a> represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, <code>Share Selection</code> is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and <em>only</em> it.</p>\n<p>After a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with <code>⌥U</code>, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af\">O P E N</a>.” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3\">DOWNLOAD</a>,” which uses the <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/\">Get Contents of URL</a> action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png\" alt=\"Blink Custom Key Presses\"></p>\n<p>An extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: <strong>custom key presses</strong>. In <code>Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses</code>, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567\">GizmoPack</a> to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png\" alt=\"Importing Keys in Blink Shell\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"remotes-with-ssh-and-mosh\">Remotes with SSH and Mosh</h2>\n<p>If you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html\">Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer</a>. I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~vilmibm\">vilmibm</a> kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png\" alt=\"Blink Autocomplete\"></p>\n<p>One of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100\">its singular mention in the docs</a>. There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto<em>suggestion</em>” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type <code>ssh T</code> or <code>mosh T</code> (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and <code>TAB</code> to complete the full <code>ssh Tilde.Town</code> or <code>mosh Tilde.Town</code> commands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png\" alt=\"Adding Files App Locations in Blink\"></p>\n<p>Once you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app\">Blink’s Files app integration</a> by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png\" alt=\"Blink File Providers\"></p>\n<p>To illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:</p>\n<h3 id=\"mini-tutorial-uploading-images-to-the-tildeverse-with-blink-shellhttpsuser-imagesgithubusercontentcom43663476193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650amov\">Mini Tutorial: <a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell</a></h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/mz8lgDFt.png\" alt=\"Novel Chat Fixed\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"chat\">Chat</h2>\n<p>The IRC client TildeTown uses is called <a href=\"https://weechat.org\">WeeChat</a> and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/\">duplicated the full User Guide</a> for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running <code>/buffer 1</code> followed by <code>help</code>. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try <code>/help bar</code> in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to <code>Fill</code> via the menus that appear with a <em>three-finger</em> tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.</p>\n<p>Assuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC <em>On The Go</em>, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh\">a whole bunch of alchemy</a> I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink\">the <code>geo</code> command</a> can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with <code>geo track</code>. Additionally, <code>geo current</code> displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,\n  “AltitudeRef” : 0,\n  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,\n  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,\n  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,\n  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,\n  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,\n  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,\n  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,\n  “DOP” : 35\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the <code>geo</code> command to make <em>ssh</em> connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.</p>\n<p>If I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478\">Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering</a>, though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and <a href=\"http://limechat.net/iphone/\">its landing page</a> proudly touts support for <em>iOS 4 multitasking</em>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally <em>Logged In</em> - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that <strong>running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today</strong>, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.</p>\n<h4 id=\"weechat-configuration\">WeeChat Configuration</h4>\n<p>The following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As <a href=\"https://tilde.town/~m455\">m455</a> pointed out, <code>fset</code> is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently <code>11</code>, but I fiddled quite a bit to find <code>9</code> more optimum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fset</code></li>\n<li><code>/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide bufflist</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide fset</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide title</code></li>\n<li><code>/bar hide nicklist</code></li>\n<li><code>/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format &quot;%M&quot;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add <code>/bar hide status</code> to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.snap.as/FhjqlFV1.png\" alt=\"Spacedust Chat-Minimal\"></p>\n<p>If indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157794243-413146bf-d004-4502-8ecd-b9bde2c10437.jpeg\" alt=\"Town TV\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"town-television\">Town Television</h2>\n<p>Due largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which <em>usably</em> supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020\">Huge Ass Samsung television</a> in ten-eighty pee.[^3]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png\" alt=\"Blink Appearance Settings\"></p>\n<p>If you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut<code>⌘O</code>, which <strong>switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display</strong>. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with <code>⇧⌘O</code>,” say <a href=\"https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window\">the docs</a>. Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with<code>geo track.</code> AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png\" alt=\"Notifications in Blink\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"other-considerations\">Other Considerations</h2>\n<p>Blink has a URL scheme - <code>blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&amp;cmd=</code> - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/\">without any real documentation</a>. I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they <em>do</em> work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that <em>something</em> happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.</p>\n<p>Somehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.</p>\n<p>Philosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is <em>all</em> I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer.

It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells *on iOS*: [**iSH Shell**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) and [**a-Shell**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438).\n\n![iSH Shell and a-Shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png)\n\nThe former is designed to emulate [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like [SW-DLT](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/) - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually [a fork](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell) of our subject app, now called “[**Blink Shell & Code**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306)” in the App Store.[^1]\n\n![bbj Out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png)\n\nBlink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its [landing page](https://blink.sh) touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On *iPad*, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of [Paul Miller’s 2018 article for *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17152482/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps) and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “[Using the iPad Pro as my development machine](https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/).” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux/macOS machine.\n\n![Apreche Reply](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png)\n\nSince I’ve [apparently](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421410673049972739) ended up with a primary life mission of *doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads*, I’ve managed to find myself [an active member](https://tilde.town/~extratone) of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from [public pages](https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136) - exclusively through [my iPhone 12 Pro Max](https://github.com/extratone/jorts). I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note [Apreche](https://tilde.town/~apreche)’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my *fucking phone*, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way. \n\n*It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.*\n\n![Blink Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png)\n\n## Locally\nFirst, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing `config` and/or `⌘,`. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available [fonts](https://github.com/blinksh/fonts) or [themes](https://github.com/blinksh/themes) - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend [CLRS](https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/CLRS.js), [Man Page](https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/Man%20Page.js), and [MonaLisa](https://github.com/blinksh/themes/blob/master/themes/MonaLisa.js), but this Post is saturated with *too* many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.\n\n![Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png)\n\nCompared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with `TAB`. Where a-Shell has `pickFolder`, Blink has `link-files`, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.\n\n![Repository Cleaning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png)\n\nLinking [*The Psalms*’ GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) in [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) with `link-files` in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. `open` also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.\n\n![BaityYouTubeThumbnail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png)\n\nSome other particularly intriguing standouts include `say`, which unfortunately does *not* use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. `facecam` will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. `openurl` will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. `code` is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.\n\n![Blink and Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png)\n\nBlink’s own “[UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup](https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/unix-roundup)” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what `skstore` does. `xcall` opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m [still trying to figure out](https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/ta27h9/docs_for_xcall_command) what the command’s options are. `ed` the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and `uptime` appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run `whois` locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of `pbcopy`. `whois bilge.world | pbcopy` copies *The Psalms* domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.\n\n![Blink Keyboard Shortcuts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png)\n\n### Keyboarding\nTo its credit, I think [Blink’s landing page](https://blink.sh) represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, `Share Selection` is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and *only* it. \n\nAfter a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with `⌥U`, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “[O P E N](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af).” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “[DOWNLOAD](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3),” which uses the [Get Contents of URL](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-contents-of-url/) action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.\n\n![Blink Custom Key Presses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png)\n\nAn extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: **custom key presses**. In `Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses`, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of [GizmoPack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmopack/id1505218567) to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.\n\n![Importing Keys in Blink Shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png)\n\n## Remotes with SSH and Mosh\nIf you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than [Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer](https://tilde.town/~extratone/wiki/getting-started/ssh.html). I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer [vilmibm](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm) kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen. \n\n![Blink Autocomplete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png)\n\nOne of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from [its singular mention in the docs](https://docs.blink.sh/whats-new#version-100). There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto*suggestion*” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type `ssh T` or `mosh T` (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and `TAB` to complete the full `ssh Tilde.Town` or `mosh Tilde.Town` commands.\n\n![Adding Files App Locations in Blink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png)\n\nOnce you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of [Blink’s Files app integration](https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app) by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.\n\n![Blink File Providers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png)\n\nTo illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:\n\n### Mini Tutorial: [Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV)\n<video controls width=\"360\" height=auto>\n  <source src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">\n</video>\n\n![Novel Chat Fixed](https://i.snap.as/mz8lgDFt.png)\n\n## Chat\nThe IRC client TildeTown uses is called [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve [duplicated the full User Guide](https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual/weechat/) for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running `/buffer 1` followed by `help`. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try `/help bar` in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to `Fill` via the menus that appear with a *three-finger* tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.\n\nAssuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC *On The Go*, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through [a whole bunch of alchemy](https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-mosh) I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, [the `geo` command](https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink) can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with `geo track`. Additionally, `geo current` displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]\n\n\t{\n\t  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,\n\t  “AltitudeRef” : 0,\n\t  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,\n\t  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,\n\t  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,\n\t  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,\n\t  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,\n\t  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,\n\t  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,\n\t  “DOP” : 35\n\t}\n\nAs you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the `geo` command to make *ssh* connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in [Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colloquy-irc-client/id302000478), though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and [its landing page](http://limechat.net/iphone/) proudly touts support for *iOS 4 multitasking*!\n\n> Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.\n\nMy memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally *Logged In* - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration. \n\nTo be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that **running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today**, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.\n\n#### WeeChat Configuration\nThe following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As [m455](https://tilde.town/~m455) pointed out, `fset` is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently `11`, but I fiddled quite a bit to find `9` more optimum.\n\n- `fset`\n- `/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9`\n- `/bar hide bufflist`\n- `/bar hide fset`\n- `/bar hide title`\n- `/bar hide nicklist`\n- `/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format \"%M\"`\n\nIf you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add `/bar hide status` to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:\n\n![Spacedust Chat-Minimal](https://i.snap.as/FhjqlFV1.png)\n\nIf indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.\n\n![Town TV](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157794243-413146bf-d004-4502-8ecd-b9bde2c10437.jpeg)\n\n## Town Television\nDue largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which *usably* supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s [Huge Ass Samsung television](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/televisions-home-theater/televisions/qled-4k-tvs/t-model-line-up-2020) in ten-eighty pee.[^3]\n\n![Blink Appearance Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png)\n\nIf you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut`⌘O`, which **switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display**. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with `⇧⌘O`,” say [the docs](https://docs.blink.sh/basics/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window). Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with`geo track.` AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.\n\n![Notifications in Blink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png)\n\n## Other Considerations\nBlink has a URL scheme - `blinkshell://run?key=[YourKey]&cmd=` - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left [without any real documentation](https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/swzphf/url_scheme_documentation/). I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they *do* work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that *something* happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.\n\nSomehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.\n\nPhilosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is *all* I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown [here](https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup) and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) [here](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307).\n\n# software #configuration\n---\n\n[1] [Blink’s icon](https://tilde.town/~extratone/icons/blink.png) is perhaps my most favorite of any application, ever.\n\n[2] Yes, that is my real location information and yes, I did include it intentionally. Please come kill me as soon as possible. Also, “DOR” is apparently an acronym for “[Dilution of Precision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_(navigation)),” which is a mildly interesting measurement to read up on.\n\n[3] As [the screenshots I captured suggest](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/307#issuecomment-1065429898), anyway. Obviously, I do not posess the means to test the true resolution display to mine eyes.\n",

I was still on the kick that’d started with my first-generation iPhone, four years earlier, and decided to take the bet. Instead of a new laptop, I entered my first vaguely-collegiate experience armed with an iPhone 4S and an original Magic Keyboard, beginning an experiment that’s more-or-less ongoing (there have been intermittent pauses, notably.)</p>\n<p name=\"eff5\" id=\"eff5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over the years since, I have accumulated a lot of evidence to suggest that number of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">iPhone</em> users who’ve used a hardware keyboard with their phone is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">extremely</em> tiny (which I believe to be entirely reasonable and inevitable,) but I think also believe it’s a dynamic that’s still worth documenting properly. Frankly, I can say definitively that <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">it absolutely has not been</strong>, thus far.</p>\n<p name=\"7d97\" id=\"7d97\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As you may have observed, even the association of iPad and keyboard in the past few years has actually made it worse — lookup any given iOS app’s keyboard shortcuts and you’ll return a list <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">for iPad</em> and nothing else. Over the years, I’ve maintained a habit of going down the iPad list, testing each shortcut on iPhone, noting down which of the iPad shortcuts respond on the latter in a table, and then emailing said list to the app’s developers. (Naturally, they almost never respond.

He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"2c71\" id=\"2c71\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"f295\" id=\"f295\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" data-href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a July article in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Barrons</em></a> quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading this year’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anchor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Megaphone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gimlet Media</a>, and — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most controversially</a> — the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property in the medium, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Joe Rogan Experience</em></a>. Though details of their implications are beyond the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume its concerns — if not its proposed solutions — should apply to the future of podcasting as well.</p>\n<h3 name=\"cfd7\" id=\"cfd7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Responsible Curation</h3>\n<p name=\"84f2\" id=\"84f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For solutions to address Spotify’s overwhelming skew toward rewarding popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that “<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half of Spotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly</a>.” <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pitchfork</em>’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, all of his examples are male.</p>\n<p name=\"460b\" id=\"460b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fast Company</em> addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" data-href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify’s $30 billion playlist for global domination</a>:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"8068\" id=\"8068\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are eroding music’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"be10\" id=\"be10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook — the CEO of the most valuable company in the history of the world — as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy — vague, at best.</p>\n<figure name=\"60cb\" id=\"60cb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/At_K4FVY198?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"ed5d\" id=\"ed5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In <a href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" data-href=\"https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May</a>, Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists.</p>\n<p name=\"70ef\" id=\"70ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in <a href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" data-href=\"http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a 2008 interview with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The HTML Times</em></a>, creating an online presence for one’s music had long been “a pain in the ass:”</p>\n<blockquote name=\"9646\" id=\"9646\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"4f3c\" id=\"4f3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of publishing one’s music as easy as possible. In <a href=\"https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/\" data-href=\"https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first post on the company’s blog from September, 2008</a>, Diamond details the results of their engineering:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"9bb3\" id=\"9bb3\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.</em></blockquote>\n<p name=\"680b\" id=\"680b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the sincerity in its commitment to artists through programs like “Bandcamp Fridays,” when the service waives its cut of artists’ revenue (ten percent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the company <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/\" data-href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">donated a Friday’s share of proceeds to the Transgender Law Center</a> in response to the Presidential Administration’s proposal to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company has repeatedly <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser\" data-href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brought back the program</a> in recognition of its impact on independent artists, and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for a specific example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed.</p>\n<p name=\"445f\" id=\"445f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> a profitable company, and has been for nearly a decade. In Dubber’s interview, Diamond explains their financial origins:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"9165\" id=\"9165\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on getting to profitability.

This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" data-href=\"https://bandcamp.com/about\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">while helping artists earn $634 million</a> as of December 2020.

Not that it’s particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in court</a>, essentially, that he didn’t know what the movie was about. I’m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the times</em>, but <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Social Dilemma</em> could’ve done better, in that regard.</p>\n<p name=\"711d\" id=\"711d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell’s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man’s screen, the film’s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">blatantly false</em> imagery. The Privacy Problem is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ridiculously</em> unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as “ridiculous,” as did one of my favs, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed\" data-href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Casey Newton</a>:</p>\n<blockquote name=\"4541\" id=\"4541\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users.

Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Verge</em>’s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">separate</em> tech media — grandmothers, retirees, etc. — who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Social Dilemma</em> and particularly susceptible to its delusions about “privacy” — a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">collection</strong> of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">examination</strong> with human eyes, which — while possible — is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.</p>\n<figure name=\"fff8\" id=\"fff8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1283173322822488064?s=20\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></figure><p name=\"0234\" id=\"0234\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now, on to the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">notably missing</strong>: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by — and directly promotes on several occasions — one particular organization, called the <a href=\"https://www.humanetech.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.humanetech.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Center for Humane Technology</em></a>, which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain… hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for “solutions” to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who’ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages — some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization’s website nor the film’s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>\n<figure name=\"ec06\" id=\"ec06\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\" data-width=\"1903\" data-height=\"937\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WLTbM0fKDyJTOCPnSQ_nDQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"e924\" id=\"e924\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> using them. What I’m here to tell you: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">you have a choice of services</strong>. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin.

Essentially, the evidence suggests that the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">alternatives</em> discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn’t immediately off-putting to “the average person.”</p>\n<figure name=\"0676\" id=\"0676\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://clyp.it/oxpup2vm/widget\" width=\"700\" height=\"258\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"0c40\" id=\"0c40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Poke around the film’s official website a bit and you’ll discover a variety of heavily-branded “resources” for “taking action,” all awash with a certain irony, including <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view\" data-href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a fucking Bingo game</a> (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">actually</em> suggests you post on your Instagram story!

All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">malice</em> in this particular destination, at least, which leaves… incompetence? I’m afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world — regardless of what they believe now, or then — that these folks should not be our first call when we’re searching for “solutions.” You know this, they know it, and they <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">explicitly acknowledged it</em> at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.</p>\n<p name=\"b82c\" id=\"b82c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Would you care to guess what <a href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1\" data-href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a> of the <a href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/\" data-href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Digital Detox Kit</em></a> is about?

My first “real” computer’s name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus’ name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that’s completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone’s common name to that of “your favorite television character” (<a href=\"https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard\" data-href=\"https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hildur Odegard</a> is my favorite character in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fortitude</em>, so…) is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it’s just that it’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ridiculously</em> low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down “change device name” as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.</p>\n<figure name=\"b938\" id=\"b938\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*RpMyrNnS3-t9X8lI.jpeg\" data-width=\"1242\" data-height=\"332\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RpMyrNnS3-t9X8lI.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">A notification I received while literally typing this out.</em></figcaption></figure><p name=\"4127\" id=\"4127\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did</em> find an “<a href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/\" data-href=\"https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Apps Centre</a>” within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the “detox” seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it’s hilarious that I can freely refer to “privacy” as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one’ social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the “Supported by Mozilla Firefox” badges all over the website and asks me “well, what did you expect?” My answer: something “more” than promotion, I suppose.</p>\n<p name=\"ca27\" id=\"ca27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I suspect this is another case of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">don’t go to those who created the problem for the solution</em>. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">More privacy</em> is a more tangible vector upon which to “innovate” than simply <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">putting down the fucking phone</em>, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">turn off all your notifications</strong>. I genuinely believe turning off <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all</em> notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I’d somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">years</em>, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who’s notifications I’d probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly.</p>\n<p name=\"db08\" id=\"db08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">turn it off</strong>, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I’d wager.) I suspect it’s long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as “<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Email Addiction</strong>” goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR’s greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email’s footer. If you’re <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">do</em> read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform’s archives feature — or don’t — but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you’ll be ready to seek out other <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Email Wellness</em> methodologies like the recently-trendy <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Inbox Zero</em>.</p>\n<p name=\"bbf1\" id=\"bbf1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">a set daily time</strong> to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it’s okay to announce on Facebook that you’re taking a break from Facebook. There <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">contact me literally any time</strong>. My personal phone number is <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">(573) 823–4380</strong>. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I’ve discovered with you.</p>\n<p name=\"e506\" id=\"e506\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">My own advice on “privacy:” don’t worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you’re an iOS user, you’ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step — if we’re really honest with ourselves — is figuring out how you’re going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental Mk. IV around — the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1 inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">thirty inches longer</em> than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht weighed some 700 pounds <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">less</em>, and it was filled with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">real wood</em>. I’m no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound has <a href=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf\" data-href=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expounding effects</a> on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle, which just about sums up the ultimate formula to <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency\" data-href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pulverize efficiency</a>. When our friends at the IIHS say that “fuel economy can be improved without sacrificing safety,” they are just… <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">fundamentally wrong</strong>, (though <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">technically</em> correct.)</p>\n<p name=\"d33f\" id=\"d33f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’m not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its experience as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for lane-keeping) <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">on</em>. Not to be too crude, but it’s fun to make the fat fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and struggle to redirect all <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/\" data-href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">266 lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels</a> beneath an entirely separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.</p>\n<p name=\"22d7\" id=\"22d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Scrambling</em> is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I’d advise you leave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It’s all about the sensation of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">power</strong>. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left over with very little gain.</p>\n<p name=\"d9c4\" id=\"d9c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trigger the former</a>. I cannot say I’d put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel? Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas’ will ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet section of back rock road and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">walked through the steps</a> to disable all of the traction and stability control assists before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any significant wheelspin.

In truth, neurotypical people are naturally driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick, inhibitionless madmen — to envy them both internally and externally (in a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of) risktaking remains pathetically irrational.

Perhaps it’s telling that the only layout I found acceptable for the digital dash was the one with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and how often do you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how useful could a digital compass in the speedometer’s center hub really be in an “offroad” situation? It’s a bit petty, but I also really despise the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It’s just… bad.</p>\n<figure name=\"4c68\" id=\"4c68\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*dxmd9MFnyLnQ-nyFSINdbQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"4032\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dxmd9MFnyLnQ-nyFSINdbQ.jpeg\"></figure><h3 name=\"50c7\" id=\"50c7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Outside</h3>\n<p name=\"a3b6\" id=\"a3b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a very ordinary way.

The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 — the Atlas’ competitor) just… stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what the fuck are you doing?</em> and such.</p>\n<p name=\"200a\" id=\"200a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti’s windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas’ driver’s side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you’d imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Uggs?</em></p>\n<p name=\"ec08\" id=\"ec08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How positive are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">much</em> more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busy one… except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was “not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">supposed</em>” to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">perturbed</em> this woman — that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage.</p>\n<p name=\"7415\" id=\"7415\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I inserted the next logical question which I’d been screaming telepathically: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">can you not get around me?</em> I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">going around</em> as a concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting “I could go around, but I don’t want to get a ticket.” Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit — nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we’d simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or the Atlas.</p>\n<p name=\"c65c\" id=\"c65c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Granted, to her I am still a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Young Man</em>, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone — even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">she is in fact their servant</em>.) Her own folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such “ugliness” (if you will) is hard-headed, an ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It’d almost be more redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually <a href=\"https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html\" data-href=\"https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">powered by a comparatively oldschool V8</a>.)</p>\n<p name=\"2b8e\" id=\"2b8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Freedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and reasonable response to Mrs. Guppy’s kind in such a situation is to very kindly oblige, which I did, of course, with great respect and great pity. In the months since this encounter, I’d been wondering what was missing from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is this analysis of fear as a factor for the American carbuyer.</p>\n<p name=\"8a3d\" id=\"8a3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Though it has been disproven over and over again for <a href=\"http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf\" data-href=\"http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decades</a>, consumers often cite <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">safety</em> as their primary motivation for buying full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy’s Great Guffaw led me to realize why this particularly disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so uninhibited by the truth: the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">brand image</em>, physical presence, and actual driving sensation must communicate and “feel” <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">safe</strong> — these are far more integral to buyers’ perception of a product than the testable reality.

That is, of course, contradictory. The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with two offset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a conventional V6, but exactly like an inline six, there’s just one cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that’s both much narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a straight six.

While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shane Langman</a>. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can’t get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we’d have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”</p>\n<figure name=\"3cb7\" id=\"3cb7\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*IbRjdgVeLHZh5cn1jTD4VQ.png\" data-width=\"710\" data-height=\"908\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IbRjdgVeLHZh5cn1jTD4VQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"8608\" id=\"8608\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm\" data-href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">streamed on Periscope</a> (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.</p>\n<p name=\"50fc\" id=\"50fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Neither are really very good ways to watch live video — Periscope, notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts — but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and it’s worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history — perhaps even more than any other — but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">much</em> more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.</p>\n<p name=\"26ba\" id=\"26ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/\" data-href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest attempts</a> to minimize its platform’s toxicity — an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cultural</em> blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure name=\"fe3f\" id=\"fe3f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*f5rcIXqPbWMljOwGen2dpQ.png\" data-width=\"2210\" data-height=\"1360\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*f5rcIXqPbWMljOwGen2dpQ.png\"></figure></div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p name=\"564d\" id=\"564d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Two weeks ago, Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html\" data-href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proudly released</a> the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 — leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and — true to form — immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available.

He was 29.</p>\n<p name=\"00fd\" id=\"00fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Stuart Stud, the Editor-in-Chief of The Sun, announced the death to the staff Thursday morning. Mr. Hole, who had moved to Superior after being scouted by the paper upon receiving his bachelor’s degree in fly fishing from New York University, succumbed to a catastrophic failure of his liver after allegedly “consuming a far greater-than-recreational quantity” of alcohol during an informal interview with an auxiliary source, according to someone familiar with the matter within the Sweetwater County Coroner’s Office.</p>\n<p name=\"8723\" id=\"8723\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In title, Mr. Hole climbed quickly from Sports Editor to Executive Daily Editor, but colleagues cited several integral, unpaid roles beyond his official functions in the newsroom.</p>\n<p name=\"bdf2\" id=\"bdf2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“He was a real winner,” said Hilary Hutch, who Hole had groomed personally to replace him as Sports Editor, “by far the sexist human being to grace this pokey office. An impossible talent. We were so lucky to be work alongside him for so long. There was no better wordsmith in the whole industry. He definitely deserved a huge raise. A true legend.”</p>\n<p name=\"a955\" id=\"a955\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">His responsibilities as Executive Daily Editor included arranging the entirety of The Sun’s print edition singlehandedly every morning, answering every staffer question with heroic brevity, captaining the paper’s infallible ethical prestige, editing all copy with an eye matched by not a one of his contemporaries, lifting and carrying all materials and equipment over 150 lbs. along with the entirety of the office’s championship-winning, regionally competitive basketball team as point guard.</p>\n<p name=\"ea85\" id=\"ea85\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“I’ve never seen anyone move like that,” said Ms. Hutch of her experiences playing on the team, “it was like he was some kind of super-evolved proto-human. We were really just baggage, mostly — decoration — but he was generous and humble about it. He never hogged the glory even though he almost always had every right to.”</p>\n<p name=\"06e7\" id=\"06e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Mr. Hole’s colleagues also described his stellar performance and natural talent as generally unappreciated in bolstering The Sun’s late entrance into digital publishing and web 2.0.</p>\n<p name=\"fada\" id=\"fada\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\">“Pivot to video,” said Mr. Stud.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I fear — if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authentic mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our parents.)

It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use of the most intimate medium.

I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and </em>thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">named</em> unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scream</a> it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" data-href=\"http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">memorize the entire screenplay</a> and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”</p>\n<p name=\"150c\" id=\"150c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad</em> could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I Am Legend </em>if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself <a href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" data-href=\"http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described </a>it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">National Treasure</em>, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad. </em>Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.</p>\n<p name=\"972d\" id=\"972d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">This <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fun </em>thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Winchester </em>(just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mom and Dad </em>does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”</p>\n</div></div>\n",

Whether it was instigated maliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to regard it as the absolute low of “American quality.”</p>\n<p name=\"9fd4\" id=\"9fd4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But why not, right? If you’re going to be forced into retirement at any moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the buffer period between? And really… If you’ve got the nogginism to climb all the way to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Chief Executive Officer</em>, you’ve figured out just how worthless your “legacy” will be after your last one-way dip into Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of achieving them. Good Ole’ Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and — though he may tell you and the rest of the world otherwise — measures himself only by the gracefulness of his transition’s execution.</p>\n<p name=\"2817\" id=\"2817\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the automotive industry, specifically, but I don’t intend to bother.</p>\n<p name=\"9635\" id=\"9635\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After some ancient memories were dug up by I-can’t-quite-recall-who, though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized relics from the period. To my knowledge, the corporation’s leadership were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.</p>\n<figure name=\"38bd\" id=\"38bd\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*dZx1sYmor9UspNfC.jpg\" data-width=\"980\" data-height=\"641\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dZx1sYmor9UspNfC.jpg\"></figure><p name=\"4a92\" id=\"4a92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Titles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Brink, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House, Johnny Tsunami, Mom’s Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie</em>, and many…many more menaces to my childhood television schedule.</p>\n<p name=\"cb67\" id=\"cb67\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program schedule I’d ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such titles and — consciously or not — planning my free time around them. Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many of them again and again…and again, so why did I feel the desire to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">voluntarily</em> revisit them?</p>\n<p name=\"1b7a\" id=\"1b7a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn’t have foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">paying</em> for the affliction I endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater implications.</p>\n<p name=\"c0b6\" id=\"c0b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That said, we flipped a smartphone — ⚠️ (<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT</strong>) ⚠️— for it and so began with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Smart House</em>. I have been obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me. There were a few period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick’s incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah’s ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the last moments.</p>\n<figure name=\"76ca\" id=\"76ca\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*CVWiAMaY3Vnz_Mzl.png\" data-width=\"1044\" data-height=\"655\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CVWiAMaY3Vnz_Mzl.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">When you think about it… ACTUALLY Race War 2.0</figcaption></figure><p name=\"b2af\" id=\"b2af\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I’d wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the question “why can’t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I</em> just be your mother?” Phisher answered with something like “because you can never comfort us.” Pat grew somber (and smaller actually — I suppose increasing her size was an in-budget method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly’s face in a failed attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping.</p>\n<p name=\"2993\" id=\"2993\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Apparently, it’s suicide for a holographic android.)</p>\n<p name=\"dd41\" id=\"dd41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Her final free words were “I will miss you all.”</p>\n<p name=\"719d\" id=\"719d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If she had been human, such a scene wouldn’t have bothered me a bit, but my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my day-to-day psyche.</p>\n<figure name=\"7db8\" id=\"7db8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*wEqZdBFrx6tQFYA7OqB0tA.gif\" data-width=\"275\" data-height=\"86\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wEqZdBFrx6tQFYA7OqB0tA.gif\"></figure><p name=\"c63e\" id=\"c63e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We’ll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own ignorance.</p>\n<p name=\"4dbc\" id=\"4dbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’m sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers I’m too weary to pretend I’ve read.</p>\n<p name=\"63d7\" id=\"63d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While I think the sentiment of the film <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was</em> somber regarding the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">inevitable</em> fate of Sarah Mouth’s brainchild, its conclusion was aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in response to the question “how’s Pat been doing?”</p>\n<p name=\"b61e\" id=\"b61e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Servitude without interference.</em></strong></p>\n<p name=\"4ce2\" id=\"4ce2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There’s a jewel for ya.</p>\n<p name=\"83d1\" id=\"83d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Next up was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Johnny Tsunami</em>, which very nearly unbearable, if we’re all honest with ourselves. It’s entertaining to watch from the perspective of race &amp; class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.</p>\n<p name=\"14de\" id=\"14de\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I think I’ll make a fan sequel one day — with dearest Brandon’s blessing, of course — involving Johnny Grandad’s assistance in offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for a total terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the delivery of reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.</p>\n<figure name=\"325f\" id=\"325f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*c9gDR0jzwZ63Bw3h.png\" data-width=\"1080\" data-height=\"864\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*c9gDR0jzwZ63Bw3h.png\"></figure><blockquote name=\"a0ea\" id=\"a0ea\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\">When Britain first, at Heaven’s command<br>Arose from out the azure main;<br>This was the charter of the land,<br>And guardian angels sang this strain:<br>“Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:<br>“Britons never will be slaves.”</em></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n",

Everywhere, there were words on the newest Stair Wiggling…everywhere THEY were wiggling… And I was being wit-bitter on the TL. For you, I’d planned on continuing in the usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossed heart.</p>\n<p name=\"2cfa\" id=\"2cfa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’m sure you’re a tolerable being, and there’s nothing you’d rather read less at this hour (whatever hour it may be,) but I really despise going to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which I buy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot sit for two straight hours without consuming something, so troubled is my stomach now with Big Boy woes.</p>\n<p name=\"9d59\" id=\"9d59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I can never escape the ambient breath odor — even in an empty theatre — and I can smell the filth in the seats on my clothes and in my hair until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we’ve racked up a significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time.</p>\n<p name=\"986a\" id=\"986a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Furious 7</em> was the last theatre experience I’d had, and it was a definite exception. Despite watching ten minutes of the ending on YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I spent the final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting the industrial weepy forces in my throat with tripplet labor breathing exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket.</p>\n<p name=\"58bc\" id=\"58bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a movie) become exhaustingly more complex and fickle. I don’t remember ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think I genuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I’ve sat through <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Cadet Kelly.</em></p>\n<p name=\"8cc9\" id=\"8cc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em>, though, is a completely different thing.</p>\n<p name=\"f214\" id=\"f214\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably more metaphorically effective food example here] — it’s something you’d regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodists treasured it more, but I wouldn’t bother debating it. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em>, though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It’s SUCH an indulgence that even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially notable considering how many individuals I’ve known as they’ve lost nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they “became” adults.</p>\n<p name=\"80d5\" id=\"80d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Metatots aside, it’s important to recognize how integral the IP’s illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It is not contained within the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters, species, cultures, and conflicts come from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away</em>… There is no more perfectly concise introductory sentence to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us from the ridiculously irrational instinct to make comparisons between fictional realities and our own that so plagues and defines the consumption of science fiction.</p>\n<p name=\"9270\" id=\"9270\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to ourselves and our familiars, which tends to hinder the complete manifestation of the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ultimate</em> sense of adventure.<br>Even to the most petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em> with externally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile investment. This is why so many (including myself) look upon <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A New Hope</em> with such fondness and favoritism — the premier of the universe was at its potential apogee from the start.</p>\n<p name=\"f636\" id=\"f636\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Though it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card is actually saying “you don’t know shit about what you’re about to see. Don’t make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it, because you’ll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior you are. From this moment until you see credits, every one of you is an ignorant little child…”</p>\n<p name=\"f785\" id=\"f785\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant. Without your experiences, you are an infant, waiting for identity. Over that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories and made theatres into a sort of cultural nursery — clinically levelled playing fields existing in a precision of usefulness that expression will never fulfill again.</p>\n<p name=\"62fb\" id=\"62fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities it enables have been unknowingly slurping away its most enchanting (but not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed through those double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely strange universe into the dank kernel-littered corridors of our own.</p>\n<p name=\"6645\" id=\"6645\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I blame contemporary society’s dependency on compartmentalization for my disappointment in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Force Awakens</em>, and, assuming you’re getting on a bit since I’ve kept your attention, you should for yours, too.</p>\n<p name=\"6c16\" id=\"6c16\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I tried my senile best to be passionate about “the new <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em> movie” as December approached, but I don’t think I finished a single web article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Old Republic</em> when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my (VERY middle-aged) raid group. “It’s not gonna be the same, but neither was J.J.‘s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Trek</em>, and I liked it…I think.” And it’s not surprising that the conversation eventually turned to the specific mechanics of lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the context, but it really emphasized for me the magnitude of the history and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotional balance. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">A New Hope </em>had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn’t possibly imburden itself as it had on those who were in the moment. In their psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with the sense of unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk who are so often stereotyped as disciples of information have begun to grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the mass of all the knowledge they’ve picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J. made a movie. (Well, six.) Today’s moms and dads find their escape in the Roku, not the bar.<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Force Awakens</em> and the decade of revivalist big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie’s drug.</p>\n<p name=\"a606\" id=\"a606\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because we both know you haven’t yet read anything you haven’t heard/read previously, I’ve really just been playing the role of a (more intelligent) Ghandi, but we’ve now finally arrived at some promising insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction. Despite its historical popularity, it’s ill-advisable to want to know by day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to go on sale, you’ve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know, definitively, what role <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Force Awakens </em>was created to perform. Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills it…adequately.</p>\n<p name=\"d9ac\" id=\"d9ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it’s ok, because they’re all just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for the rebellion against the Queen!</p>\n<p name=\"8145\" id=\"8145\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Um.</p>\n<p name=\"1f0d\" id=\"1f0d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I mean… the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!</p>\n<p name=\"c17e\" id=\"c17e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed, the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme’s jarring introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I actually smiled <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">involuntarily</em>, which is tremendously embarrassing to admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model of the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Moderate Fashion</em>, which would now be worth a lot of money (or so I’m told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.</p>\n<p name=\"8439\" id=\"8439\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through the screen’s grasp after the “obligatory” scrolling yellow text -&gt; “there’s a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from the adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em> about anything I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly NOT <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Wars</em>. There’s no need to mess about; it’s clearly an alternate reality from the one we’ve known. J.J.‘s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Trek</em>was in such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the production. Traditionally, Lucas’ IP wouldn’t necessarily allow for this exemption, but nobody’s been all that vocal in confronting it, to my knowledge.</p>\n<p name=\"15cd\" id=\"15cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise, which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable) alternative: <br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">LET THEM DIE</strong>.</p>\n<p name=\"22ef\" id=\"22ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Despite millions of dollars worth of polish, they’ve still ended up feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.</p>\n<p name=\"4131\" id=\"4131\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Your son is <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">DEAD</strong>, Georgino. There are some things man would do better by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative talent spent on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">new ideas</em> instead of desperate attempts to charm and cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers’ spectrum. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">So much sweat</em> shed trying to recreate the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">new franchise</em> bewitchment is embarrassingly cowardly when one could just <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">create a new franchise</em>.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

While it is true that he's been known to occasionally forgo performing at events in favor of desperately demanding answers from his audience to questions like \"how big am I?\" \"how are we able to breathe in here?\" and \"who is the whispering lady who turns off the sun?!\" I don't think he is befit of such a reputation. In fact, I think Skrillex's ability to make his irresistible clanking is one we should all aspire to hone. While we are kept on edge sometimes by the day-to-day stresses of contemporary life, Skrillex is able to clank them away and see the world from the broadest, slowest perspective - as a demigod.\n",
